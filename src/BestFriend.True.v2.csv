My best friend is so warm and inviting. The first time I met her I felt like I had known her forever. I told her my life story, that's how comfortable I felt talking to her. She has the nicest smile and the funniest laugh!She has been there for me during good times and bad...she held my heart when it was broken when my son died and then again when I found out I had cancer. She dropped everything and came to be with me both times even tho' she was having problems of her own. I love this girl with all my heart. ;Positive
My best friend Josh and I spend almost everyday together. We talk about everything together from politics to meaningless nonsense. He can always make me smile, even if I am in the worst mood. One day, Josh bought me a set of paintbrushes to surprise me on a bad day. ;Positive
My best friend is a loveable, adorable geek.  She manages to make getting yogurt in her hair on and her back amusing and cute.  She is fiercely protective and would do anything for her family.  She is equally comfortable playing video games or clubbing it up at night.  We also share a passion for musical theater.;Positive
My best friend is someone I met over 8 years ago. Despite our petty arguments, we always realize that we need each other more than it is worth it to hold grudges. We have so much in common that it's impossible for us to stay mad at one another. We share a similar sense of humor, similar taste in such things as movies, books, and music, and we both like to relax at home as much as we like to get dressed up and go out dancing. Having been through so much in the past 8 years-graduating from high school, going to college, moving away from home, rushing a sorority, graduating from college, applying to law school, student teaching, etc-there are few people who have been there for all of it, but my best friend has. ;Positive
A and I have been friends for 5 years. He is always there for me when I am having a meltdown about something. We can get into a big fight and still continue being friends. One time he told me he hated me and never wanted to talk to me again. Yet, the very next day we were airtight again. This is why we are such good friends. Our ability to not carry a grudge and love one another no matter what helps us to stay close.;Positive
My best friend and I have a lot in common. We have similar interests.  She is a kind-hearted and generous person.  She is fun and genuine.;Positive
Me and my best friend used to spend all of our time together. We'd go to the movies in the middle of the night, then walk to the grocery store by my house and wander around it for a while before finally going home. We could stay up all night not saying much at all and understanding each other perfectly. We even have nicknames for each other, I am her garbanzo bean, and she is my weasel ball.;Positive
My best friend is more like my sister. We have never fought. We are now college roomates and i love every minute of it. We have several inside jokes that only each other understands. She is my best friend and I can trust her with anything.;Positive
My best friend always is there to talk and is always understanding about what's going on in my life. We've known each other since college where we met at the television station. He has the same interests as I do and is always willing to go to sporting events with me. Finally, he helps me out with all of my women issues which I seem to have hundreds of. ;Positive
Friends since early childhood, we have fought many times over the years but understand one another. After being we friends for over 2 decades we understand that we each have similar values and similar outlooks when it comes to new people or situations.  My best friend is someone I can count on to be there for me without questions regardless of the situation.;Positive
My best friends are with me for ten years. Until now I have never not in the least disappointed. Them by two. One with different side of the state come to me only because they were on the phone zvucilo that place. Very like one another;Positive
My best friend is very easy to talk to and even though we seldom get together there's never an awkward moment when we meet.  She has a lot of funny stories to share, but she also likes to hear my stories.  Our conversations never feel competitive, just fun.  Our lives are very different but I guess our personalities have enough in common to make us friends.  I look forward to getting together with her and have gone through many inconveniences to do so.;Positive
I have been best friends with Jessica for about seven years now. She has always been there to help me out. She was even in the delivery room with me when I had my daughter. She was also one of the Bridesmaids in my wedding. She lives six hours away, but if we need each other we'll make the drive without even thinking about it.;Positive
she's always there for me anytime and anywhere just give her a call. we stick together through thick and thin,money don't matters. she accept me for what i am,my good and bad attitudes,habits,anything. i love her with all my heart and want our friendship to last forever. i wanna grow old with her and watched our grandchildren grow and be friends the way we were.;Positive
History seems to be the glue of a friendship. No matter what, it seems as though your friends know where you came from and know where you going. It is the reason why there is such a strong bond. The fact that no matter where you are in this world, you will always have that one someone to turn to. ;Positive
My best friend is trustworthy and can keep a confidence.  He is also a man of his word and commitment.  He is sensitive to other persons and situations. My best friend is the kind of person who will give you his last dime and the shirt off of his back.  My best friend is my husband, he loves me for what he can give to me and not for what he could take from me, and I call that godly love. He shares in my successes and in my failures, he is a constant companion and encourager, he celebrates my life and he has seen me at my best and worst and still cares for me.;Positive
My best friend and I have been together since we were kids. He was also my classmate. We were very much close with one another as we often invited each other to our homes. We will either play or just watch some movies. On special occasions, both our families will visit one another which is why he and I are very close. I always have a place to express my feelings whenever I feel down or mad. He was always there to support me emotionally and he was always there physically for me each time I needed him. A best friend, I can always count on and trust. Unfortunately, he passed away a few years ago due to an illness which shocked all of our families. I'll definitely miss him terribly up to this day.;Positive
My best friend is my girlfriend Susan. She is always there for me. If I ever feel blue, I know I can call on her and she will cheer me up. Susan is very upbeat. She is one of those people who look at the glass as half full instead of half empty. We have been friends for over 45 years and I don't ever see her not being in my life. ;Positive
"My best friend and I have been best friend for about 16 years off and on.  We don't get to see each other all that much because of college and little free time, but when we do hang out, we can pick up where we left off.  There is no """"drama"""" in our relationship.  We are just friends who can talk without having to worry about what the other really thinks.  Since we don't see each other that often, we don't have time to get on each other' nerves, and we are excited to spend time together when we get the chance. """"";Positive
My best friend never gives me a hard time about anything. If we don't see each other or talk to each other for a while, it's not like anyone's mad. We could not see each other for years, and if we met up it would be like nothing happened. A lot of people in life can make you feel like your being judged, and most of the time make you feel that what your doing isn't good enough. My best friend is one of the few people I don't feel that way around.;Positive
"My best friend is someone whom I've known for 32 years.  Like the relationship between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin in the seafaring series by Patrick O'Brian, """"my particular friend"""" is someone who operates from absolute integrity, honesty, and sincerity.  She has never lied to me, has never used me to further her own purposes, and has never canceled a """"date"""" with me because she was asked out at the last minute by a male.  Although she is one of the smartest people I know (and I know a lot of really smart people), she is not arrogant, bombastic, nor overbearing in how she shares what she knows.  Furthermore, she is incredibly funny.  Almost everytime we are together, we laugh hysterically.  Lastly, she is a """"every weather friend.""""  When times are tough, she's right there with me and offers me the most valuable thing a human being can offer another human being:  a listening, uncritical heart.  When I recently had an unexpected and very scary surgery, she immediately, with no hesitiation, was willing to rearrange her schedule to be with me in whatever way I needed.  If everyone in the world operated like her, we would have a very peaceful, happy world.""""";Positive
My best friend is very helpful to me. I know too that she trusts me because she confides in me whenever she has something on her mind. When she has problems, she does not hesitate to ask for my help. Same with me, whenever Im stuck somewhere, she's the first person that comes to my mind for help. If I don't call her for a few days, she calls me up to just check on me. No wonder we've been friends for more than ten years now.;Positive
My best friend is very loyal. They always have something to say that makes me feel better about my day. She also helps me out when i need someone to tell my troubles to. I appretiate the honesty she gives me when i know i am wrong and she tells me. We talk very often and are actually quite different but that makes us better friends i think.;Positive
She was always there for me whenever I needed her.  Her praises would be sincere and to the point.  She was my best critic too.  She would tell me on the face if she did not like something about me.  I always compared her to a sieve.  My bad qualities would glare at me from above the sieve and good qualities would be sifted through!  Aren't good friends supposed to do just that?  Friends are God's own gifts on earth.  Our friendship has lived through toughest times as also fun times like shopping, movies, eating and enjoying to the hilt.;Positive
My best friend is my boyfriend. He became my best friend after my last best friend left me for alcohol and drugs, and while I was hurting, he picked up the pieces and helped me to move past the fact that my past friend didn't want me around anymore. He listened to my cry, and held me when I needed comfort. He shopped with me for clothes and took me to get my hair done. We ate chocolate cake and stayed in bed watching movies. I never knew that romance could be mixed with friendship, but he taught me that the most important part of being inlove was also being best friends too. I appreciate how devoted he was to proving me that he wouldn't leave me like she did.;Positive
My best friend is always supportive and really comes through for me when I need her.  I am always amazed by what she\u2019s willing to do to look out for me.  We have been friends for more than 12 years, and I count her as one of the true blessings in my life.  While we don\u2019t talk on the phone all that regularly, or even live near each other anymore we remain close.  I have found that friendships like this are truly rare and a thing to be appreciated.;Positive
My friend Maria is my best friend. She knows me as I am and accepts me as I am;Positive
What I like the most about my best friend is that she always has time for me when she senses that I need her the most.  She can make me cry and then turn around and make me laugh so hard I can't catch my breath. We have been friends for 28 years and I still learn new things about her and our friendship.  She once told me that if she and her husband ever won the lottery and moved from the neighborhood that my husband and I would have to come and check out houses in the new neighborhood because she would give us a new house there so we could always be neighbors.  She never judges and never intrudes but will gently ask a question or tow if she senses something is not right in my world.  If I don't want to tell her right then, that's okay with her and she doesn't push.  I really hope that I am as good a friend to her as she is to me.;Positive
My bestfriend and I have known each other for over 20 years.  I would not trade him for the world. He knows all of my faults and he still loves me. We even tend to have the habit of finishing each other's sentences.  He is like another extension of my body.;Positive
My best friend has always been there for me. I have known her for over 10 years, and she knows EVERYTHING about me. She's always there to give me advice, and is my rock when my world is crumbling down. We go on trips, and have the most fun together. She shares the same humor as me, and we always make friends wherever we go. ;Positive
My best friend and I get along very well.  We have never had a fight over anything, and even if we disagree, we take the time to talk things over and try to reach an agreement we are both happy with.  I love spending time with my best friend, we always have fun together, even when there is nothing to do.  One of the reasons we get along so well is that we both have a very weird sense of humor.  I can rely on her for anything, and I hope she feels the same about me.;Positive
I have known my best friend for over 30 years. She is always available when I need her. She gets me and my situations without me having to provide details about things I feel. We have experienced many joys and many heartaches along the way and it has just brought our friendship closer. Our children are not the same age yet we find so many interesting things to do to bring our families together. I do not know how I would have made it through this far without her love and guidance.;Positive
Laurie and I have been friends for over forty years, having met while we were both sophomores in high school.  We have lived in the same city most of the time, but at various points in time we've lived thousands of miles apart.  That has never mattered.  Even if it has been a year since we've spoken, or if we've been five thousand miles apart, at the next phone call it's like we just saw each other last week.  Our connection has always been that strong.;Positive
My buddy Dan and I have been friends for 25 years. One of the reasons we have remained friends for so long is that we respect each other's space. Dan doesn't push me to do things I don't want to do, and I treat him the same way. It also helps that Dan and I are roughly the same age, and share a similar outlook on life. In addition, neither of us worries small things to death. When we go out, sometimes he pays, sometimes I pay, and who pays for what and who paid last time does not bother us in the least.;Positive
She is extremely giving, supportive, and caring. I know I can always count on her to be honest with me and to be there when I need her. She can be a bit talkative, but she knows this about herself and doesn't get offended if I do something else while she's talking -- we both know she needs to process things verbally and that doesn't always mean I need to be listening. She is a lot of fun, extremely intelligent, and always has a fun story to share. It's been a long time since I've had another female who I enjoy spending time with, but she changed that! ;Positive
My best friend I have known since high school. We share the same tastes in music and movies and 1980's nostalgia. He is a great guy and would always lend a friend the shirt off his back. I have never seen him be petty or mean.;Positive
My best friend and I are very opposite but very the same.  We are easy going and relaxed.  We don't argue and she is very understanding.  She is always on my side even if I am wrong because she is a true friend.;Positive
She and I have remained friends for more than 20 years because we have experienced similar events in our lives and can really relate to each other.  We do not judge one another and we can always find something funny in a bad situation to cheer the other up.  It's a friendship that is ongoing, but not necessarily an everyday thing.  Months can go by without talking to one another (we both have infants) but we seem to be able to catch up in minutes on the phone.  She has strong and intelligent characteristics as do I, which means we always have something good to talk about.;Positive
My best friend is someone I can discuss anything with.  There is never a judgment made by either of us but we do suggest better solution if we have a problem.  Recently he went through a very difficult time with his daughter and when he shared it with me I was able to provide help for her and it helped him deal with the situation.  The reason we became good friends is we both place small values on things but place high value on relationships.;Positive
My best friend is amazing. We talk a lot during the course of the day.. Not only are we both married and both have children we also hang out together. She never tells me what I want to hear but instead keeps it real in a polite way. And if I need her she is always there for me and vice a verse.;Positive
I am best friends with Erin because we have a lot in common. We greatly enjoy the experience of growing and preparing our own food from seed, and we often swap seedlings and recipes. We both like to read and have toyed with the idea of starting a book club. Unfortunately, I don't get to see her as much as I would like since I moved out to the 'burbs. But we make efforts to get together and keep in touch via e-mail. She is very loyal, compassionate, intelligent, and understanding. ;Positive
She's always there when i need to talk, always a shoulder to cry on when i need a friend. We can have some really GOOD TIMES AS WELL, WE'RE ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH, SO WE CAN KNOW WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME WHEN WE GO OUT TOGETHER. She's just fun to be with;Positive
I've known my best friend for almost 4 years. She gives great advice, and is constantly helping me work through problems that I'd go crazy trying to deal with on my own. She's always there, even when I text her in the middle of the night because I can't sleep. She has a great laugh, too, and tells the most awesome stories - ones that leave us both gasping for air and holding our aching sides, unable to stop laughing.;Positive
We have an incredible friendship. He tells me when I am being stupid, but he is also very supportive. We're always there for each other. I can trust him with my life. I know he will always be around for me. ;Positive
First, were good friends because we are related by blood.  We also have a passion for all things electronic.  We both are interested in many of the same things, but that being said we also have enough interest in other things that we learn new stuff from each other.  We're both around the same age and grew up together.  We share many things with each other that we wouldn't with anyone else.;Positive
John makes me laugh every time we talk, and even though he's recently moved to London, we still email daily, so I'm always reading things off my iphone email and laughing as I walk down the street  just because John has a twisted sense of humor. Luckily I have the same twisted sensibilities. We are both shopaholics, addicted to antiquing and flea markets and clothes shopping so the boy and I can really do some damage if let loose with our amex cards. Sometimes you need someone else who talks Prada. I think he nd I are friends because we are both givers, not takers and people sometimes take advantage of us, and we both recognize that quality in each other. John wouldn't say no to anyone about anything, and it sometimes frustrates me, because he's such a great guy and I don't think he's altogether happy with the way life is going, but he doesn't want to rock the boat and hurt anyone else by standing up for himself. He is the loyalist person I know with a heart as big as the whole world and then some. I am lucky to have him as a friend. I can be real with him and tell him when I'm scared of life and when I'm having big doubts. He is the only person I trust to tell me the truth (other than my husband -- and then sometimes even tell me the truth about my husband!) I love JOhn and wish he would move back home soon.;Positive
i have a friend i have known over 20 years.  she is a very intelligent, caring person who works in the mental health field.  she has very astute insights about psychology.  she is close to my age so we have a lot of common points of references.  she was raised a catholic  and is still practicing.  i was too but not practicing but we still share a common background.  ;Positive
"Will and I met in a library. We discovered we liked the same books and movies. As children, we both loved the tv show """"Batman"""". That was 20-some years ago and we still enjoy going to the movies and concerts together. We share the same visions about so many things and we cried together when Barack Obama was elected president. """"";Positive
She is the kind of person who is good at most things I don\u2019t, and I like to think that she relies on me the way I rely on her. She can stand my erratic temper, and she doesn\u2019t mind even if I\u2019m not a person who can easily say sorry. She introduced me to a lot of fun new things I didn\u2019t even dare to think about before, and she\u2019s very open-minded about my wild suggestions too. We know each other enough not to doubt our honesty, thus I feel safe to share my secrets with her.;Positive
We have been friends since our high school days, that was 14 years ago. So we are 25 years and we are still best friends. I say best friends are one's that truely knows you inside out. One that cries with you when you are so lonely and laughs with you when you are so happy. A friend for me is one that is just there, ready to listen and not to judge you. A friend is one you can trust with your life and that is my bestfriend. I definitely trust her.;Positive
I had very good friend when i was studying my 10th standard.She is very affectionate towards me.such a caring, loving  and understanding.But i was not able to understand her true in very begning. Thing whichm are revelant to me and my friend is we both are possessive on eachother,but we could not realise until the other person came  and parted us.Because of over possessiveness our friendship sailed in very difficult situtation.;Positive
My best friend is Craig.  We have been friends since we were born, basically, since our parents new each other.  We are such good friends because we have so much shared life experience.  We went to summer camp together and went to the same church.  We have a lot of common opinions, but we also disagree about things.  What keeps us together is mutual respect for each other even if we disagree.;Positive
Jay is my best friend and has been for almost 10 years.  We of course fight on ocassion, we are like the odd couple.  We are always pondering how we ended up such good friends as we are so completely different.  He likes sports and technology and I love music and literature.  I would go to an art museum in a heart beat while he wouldn't be dragged there by his hair.  He much prefers golfing and I think it has to be the most boring sport in the world.  He hasn't read a book since highschool and I read one a week.  He is all about the action movies with blood, gore, and blowing things up.  I love comedies with Jim Carey.  The funny part is, no matter what we are doing, we always have fun together.  Even if he is watching wrestling and I am reading, we just click for some reason.  I think our saving grace is our sense of humor and the fact that we are both so open minded.;Positive
My best friend is also my boyfriend who I've been with for about two years now. We became close soon after we first met and have been that way ever since. I could not think of any other person I would rather be best friends with. He is the type of person that will put you ahead of himself, he's honest and anall around fun person to be around.;Positive
I am a girl and my best friend is a boy. We met at school, and, as my computer was demaged, i asked him to help me. From then, we talked on the internet a lot, hours, until morning, about everything. He told me personal things, about his parents, his family in general, his relationship, and also about him.There were things no one knew about. We were honest one to each other, we shared opinions and advices. We have a strong relation, but there is not evena single person who knows about it, because there will be strange rumors about us. They couldn't understand thet we have a strong friendship, and nothing else.;Positive
There is one friend of mine who is very dear to me. The best thing about him is listens to my talk very carefully and respond too in a very intelligent way. In others words he is a very good listener. He never wants me to go wrong in any case. He used to tell me that always take care of your parents . They are like GOD to us. He is the one who always comes on my birthday first!He really cares for me and my family.;Positive
We are best friends because she is always there for me. She listens to me when I'm down and crying. We go shopping together and she helps me pick out outfits. We have alot in common and have alot of fun together.;Positive
My best friend is the most amazing person in the world. She is very sincere and always supports me in all that I do. She offers me advice when I need it most and often helps me to see things when I am being irrational. Our relationship has grown so much that I feel like she is my sister.;Positive
We have been best friends for about 15 years. My biggest issue with him is his lack of commitment to relationships and completing college (at night). I find that he is dedicated to work not too much, but more than the other things in his life. I think he would make a great father if he would put an effort into his relationships. He could also do much better in his carreer if he would complete college, but one or two classes a year will not get it done. ;Positive
My best friend is always there when I need her.  When Im sad she gives me comfort and when Im happy she shares in my joy.  She is a constant companion that is loyal and loves me for who I am.  She never judges me and can read my emotions and feelings.  When we are apart I miss her and think of her and just the thought of her makes me smile.  I love my best friend and its a shame that more people cant find a friendship or love like this one.  ;Positive
My best friend knows me better than I know myself. Wshen we argue it never lasts more than a day and he is always there to listen. He will make me happy when I'm down and laugh when I want to cry. He will take the kids out for a few hours when I feel as i I was going to explode, and bring them back just as I start to miss them.;Positive
"The friendship I have with my best friend is wonderful. She is a great person and a wonderful friend. She is there for me when I need her, she makes me laugh when I am sad, and she picks me up when I am down. She lives 200 miles away so we dont get to see each other very often but we talk all the time. When we do get to visit each other, things havent changed one bit. We are still the best of friends. I think it helps because while we have alot in common, we have very different views on things like life and politics. The adage """"opposites attract"""" is very true about our friendship. """"";Positive
My best friend has earned her title, I can literally tell her anything in confidence and know that I can trust her enough not to tell a single soul.  We grew up together, been best friends now for about 12 years.  She always knows exactly how I feel, even if I don't tell her.  She makes me laugh more than any other person I know, and some of my most precious childhood memories I share with her.  She has never been afraid to tell me exactly what she thinks about my life, never afraid to tell me where I went wrong.  She has proven herself day in and day out to be loyal, trustworthy, consistent, fun, caring, I could go on and on all day about her.  Our personalities are entirely different, but so much alike at the same time, we do butt heads at times because of this, but it's so hard to stay mad at her.  ;Positive
"Glenn and I have been best friends since about 5 seconds since we first met.  I knew instantly that Glenn was gay, well everybody knew that Glenn was gay, except Glenn.  We suffered thru college together, got drunk together, gabbed constantly together, shared all the same likes and dislikes that are too numerous to list.  Best friends.  Then after college he all of the sudden gave me the, """"I need some space"""" speech.  I thought it would just last a few days, but it turned into weeks, months and then years.  I tried to reach out to him, but I was always rejected.  Then 8 years had gone by and I get a Christmas card from him.   I knew instantly from his handwriting who it was.  Then I noticed the gay flag sticker on the envelope.  I opened up the card which Glenn had poured his heart out into telling me that he was gay.  I called him at his new phone number, he of course knew it was me calling having calculated the amount of time it would take for the post office to deliver the card.  I said, """"Got your Christmas card...DUH!""""  We laughed and cried and quickly caught up on each others lives.  I love the knucklehead, he makes me smile just thinking about him and I know I can always count on him.  He will be my maid of honor at my wedding, and I was his best """"man"""" at his wedding.""""";Positive
My best friend Laura can be best described as my reflecting pool  We call each other once a week and share everything that's been going on in our lives for the last seven days.  But the best part about Laura is that she knows me so well, she can offer advice that's genuine.  We both provide each other with positive tools to reflect.;Positive
"My best friend and I can """"hang out"""" anywhere, any time and have fun. We have a sort of connection that's hard to describe. Much of it probably has to do with shared interests. We both really enjoy working with technology and creating things. We now live very far apart, but I'd like to think our friendship is still every bit as close.""""";Positive
We are such good friends because we are total opposites.  She is like night and I am like day.  We both make each other laugh and we always have a good time despite how different we are.  Our one commanlity is that we both are mothers of 2 year old boys, we have both learned to be mothers together.;Positive
My best friend is wonderful because she is always there for me when I need a shoulder to cry on.  She lets me borrow her clothes when I have nothing appropriate to wear. She Lets me know when I have something in my teeth, or I look unacceptable to go out in public.  I know she will answer the phone in the middle of the night If I needed her and will always find a way to make me laugh.  We finish eachothers sentences and can communicate in a crowded room without saying a word.;Positive
My best friend is someone I can share anything with without fear of being judged.  She always stands up for me no matter what;Positive
My best friend is a woman that I became friends with when we were both college students. We have maintained our friendship despite the fact that we have not lived in the same state for more than twenty years. We both have the same type of sarcastic humor and still crack each other up. I trust that she would never betray a confidence and she always gives me a straight answer, even when it is difficult to do so. We keep in touch by phone and e-mail, as well as several visits during the year. I value her friendship and love tremendously.;Positive
I have known my best friend since 3rd grade. We have been apart for lengthy times and once we lived near each other again, we picked up where we left off. I feel as if I know her and she knows me. I trust her and I ask for her advice. We respect each other's lives, like each others husband and children and don't get offended if the other is too busy for the other.  She is sincere and doesn't ever make me feel bad.  I could call her in the middle of the night and she would be there. My family loves her and knows her. We can giggle like school girls and cry like the grown women we are together.  We listen to one another. ;Positive
"I have known my best friend for nearly eleven years, and although we are living in different states we are still very close.  I know that I could tell her anything, and if I had a problem she would drop everything to help me.  I know her family very well, and she knows mine.  We joke around that we have a """"curse"""" because every time we are together one of us gets hurt, or we break something.  We are both silly, and can be immature when we hang out together, but it is because of this that we enjoy each others company so much.""""";Positive
I met Anna at university, when she asked to borrow my lecture notes. I thought she seemed really disorganised, but I lent her the notes and we just became friends from there. She's really important to me, now. I went to her wedding, and now she is widowed with a young son. She's been through such a lot, but she has huge inner strength and I really admire her. She's clever, fun, trustworthy, loyal and always surprising. I hope we will always be friends, even though we don't see each other very often these days.;Positive
My best friend and I have similar opinions on a lot of important topics (religion/politics etc) and even if we don't agree on something we respect each other enough to be able to have a mature interesting discussion about our beliefs. We also make each other laugh all the time, we love watching movies together and cracking jokes about them, I feel that this ability is what bonds us. We are comfortable telling each other anything and always want the others honest opinion concerning any problems we are having in our lives. We know the other person cares so we can be brutally honest with each other and this also leads to our forming a stronger bond. I know my best friend would do anything for me and I would do anything for her.;Positive
I am a guy and I have a girl as my best friend. We both share a very healthy relationship. She is my best friend because she just understands me better than anyone else I have ever met. She can tell herself without my need to say that what I want to say. Time seems running to me in her company. I can chat with her whole day and she also does this for me. She never hides anything from me. She always does those things which please me and even if I get upset with her she tries her level best so that our friendship continues as such. She really is best person for me in my life.;Positive
I've known my best friend for 38 years. We grew up together as neighbors. From the age of nine, we played together and hung out constantly. Now that we're older, there have been long periods of time when we haven't seen each other. It doesn't matter: She's just as sweet and loyal as ever. We'll always be best friends.;Positive
"My best friend accepts me as I am.  She listens to me even when she does not agree with what I say.  She """"knows"""" when I have a need for her to talk to me.  For example: I will feel down and she calls me before I call her.  She says she senced my mood and that I needed her.  I get the same feelings.  One great thing is that we don't have to talk to each other or see each other each day but when we talk and meet we create special moments to remember.""""";Positive
My best friend is a person that I can tell anything that is going on in my life good or bad. If I am having problems she supports and offers her opinion without being pushy. We laugh, we cry, we share all of our good and bad times. She has never hurt my feelings and supports me in anything that I do. I let my car run out of gas one time and she drove 60 miles because I was standing on the side of the road in a dress and heels just to bring me a gallon of gas and then she took me to lunch because she knew at that point I was having a bad day. I wouldn't trade my best friend for a million dollars even in these hard economic time. I love her more than a sister.;Positive
My best friend is a person of the opposite sex.I think one of the reasons we get along so well is that there is no competition against us,like who dresses the best,is prettiest,etc.We can cut through all of that nonsense and just be real. We are the same age,and have shared many life experiences that are the same.He is trustworthy.I can tell him anything.We both know that we can trust and believe in one another and that is what keeps our friendship going.;Positive
my best friend NEVER lies to me, at the same time they phrase their response to something I might do, that they don't agree with in a way that's not hurtful. My best friend has always been there for me no matter what hour of the day or night. They know all about me, but like me anyway.;Positive
My best friend is my sister, we are close in age so we were friends from high school on.  As adults though she has truely became my best friend.  She is always there to listen or help when needed.  She let me live with her for a month when I was moving accross country, and pet sits for me when I need to go out of town.  What keeps us together (aside from being related and thus hanging out even at family functions) is our abiltiy to forgive and understand each other.;Positive
My best friend and I have been friends for around 19 years, my longest friendship.  We met each other in Junior High School, thus have been through a great deal together.  She's kind and honest and has an extremely big heart.  She and I have continued to grow closer with age, rather than growing distant as many friendships do.;Positive
Jean is my best friend.  I have known her for over 20 years.  She is the most honest person I have ever known.  That is why we are still friends.  She is the only friend I have ever loved.  I believe she feels the same way about me.  I can always depend on her, she has never let me down.  She is also the most intelligent person in my life. I would be very unhappy with out her friendship.;Positive
My friend is sincere, trustworthy, and always honest.  She is beautiful inside and out.  She's reliable, hard-working, and always seeks to make others comfortable.  She has an amusing sense of humor.;Positive
I love my best friend. He is a very awesome person. There are many reasons why he is my best friend. I feel that i can truly trust him is the number one reason. How can you have a friend that you can't trust? When I am down he is there by my side making me feel better. Having a best friend is important. I know that I can be me and say whatever i want and not be judged. He knows who I am, and I love that about him.  Also I can always count on his honest opinion. That in my opinion is what keeps a friendship strong.;Positive
My best friend is a very sweet person. She is very caring and trustworthy. You could tell her any secret and it would always be safe. She is also very fun and funny.;Positive
"I've been friends with Jason since 10th grade.  When we first met it was for a game of """"War Games"""", where we would go into the woods and throw eggs, firecrackers, and bags of floor at each other.  Our group of friends has gone camping several times since then, sometimes for a week straight.  Jason and I share alot of interests and have found our views on life are very much in common.""""";Positive
My friend L. is very giving and helpful.  She is generous whenever someone is in need of help and even when they're doing fine.  She also takes good care of her pet.  She is reliable and a good employee too.  ;Positive
I have known my best friend my entire life.  We are actually cousins.  She and I started and finished school together.  My friend is kind, fun, loving and a good person.  We do not see each other as much as we would like because of distance, but when we do it is like we were never apart.  I trust her completly.  She is hard working and honest.  I respect her very much.;Positive
She's so much fun to talk to -- with other people, there's generally a sort of awkward silence that arises whenever we run out of things to say, but with her, we just keep talking. She cares about the same things that I care about, and for mostly the same reasons -- and when we disagree on something, we usually have really fun arguments about it. Not angry, just fun. She's into history and old things, can't stand arrogance, and seriously lacking in self-confident.;Positive
Stacy and I have been friends since high school. She is an extremely compassionate and ethical person and a defender of anyone weaker or less fortunate. She is generous with her family and friends as well as with strangers. She has an infectious laugh and a winning personality that everyone responds positively to. Children and dogs both love her, which is, in my opinion, one of the best signs of a truly kind person.;Positive
I love my best friend! He is also my husband. He is very supportive, funny, and sincere. He is always telling me that I'm a great wife and mother, and our personality's just work really well together. He's a lot like me in some ways, for instance he's very easy going, and likes to have fun. He's also me opposite in other ways like his spending habits. He's a spender, while I'm a saver. He's very detailed which makes him slow at getting things done, while I'm very fast and not as detailed. Together we make the perfect team.;Positive
My best friend is a very caring person who always puts her family before all things. I can always depend on my best friend in times of need. She seems to always know when I need a good laugh or pick me  up. My best friend is caring, loving and kind. ;Positive
My best friend and I have a lot in common.  We share favorite TV shows, music, movies, books, etc.  Besides that, the best thing about our friendship is that we are very honest with each other.  This makes it easy and comfortable to tell each other anything.  We are also very dependable to each other, and we respect each other very much.  ;Positive
I have been very good friends with my best friend for almost 10 years now. Since our childhood we've shared the same interest. We hangout together. Share each and every dirty secret with each other and then there are those times when one of us is feeling low and the other one comforts and tries to give u some good piece of advice. Personally I dont know where i would be without my best friend because there are some things which u can only share with your best friends.;Positive
If ever I have had a better friend who loves me and accepts the person I am despite the vast differences in culture, I sure can't think of one better than Jeanne.  Right from the beggining, she has shown nothing but love and understanding.  She never says I am wrong, only offers different ways of seeing any situation.  She is the most talented, non-judgemental person I have ever met.;Positive
Kristy is the kind of friend everyone needs in their life.  Her heart is pure gold and her compassion is second to none.  The security of knowing if I ever needed her, no matter the time, place, or situation, she would be there without hesitation is something that is a treasure.  In my worst moments in life she was there and just knowing that seemed to make things look a bit brighter.  In short, I use her example as how I want my own life to be.;Positive
I met my best friend through my job. We worked together for a couple of years when we realized we shared a sense of humor;Positive
This girl is sweet but doesn't want you to know it! She has a huge smile, I wish she would use it more. We hang out and have fun together. My life is better for having known her.;Negative
Jessi and I are the greatest friends. We like to go out to parties together and meet new people. We like to go shopping together for bargain deals. She bought me a wooden pear sculpture as a surprise for my art gallery. We enjoy spending time hanging out.;Negative
My best friend is a spastic mess sometimes but her heart is always in the right place.  She loves to travel and is always willing to share tips on the best places to go.  She welcomes friends into her home at any time and does her best to make you feel comfortable.  She enjoys food and can usually be trusted when it comes to restaurant recommendations.;Negative
I work with one of my best friends. She is so easy to work with that we've gotten along since the beginning. We compliment each other when we work together. She helps me and I help her. Our shared strong work ethic shines through as we strive to get things done. She is not only a great coworker, but a great friend who I know I can trust with even my most private secrets. ;Negative
Jr. and I have been friends through thick and thin. He is such a caring and considerate person. As my best friend, he always puts my needs before his own. He is never selfish when it comes to me. He calls me everyday just to make sure I'm ok. One day, he could not get in touch with me so he called my mom because he was worried about me. Jr. is the best friend I could ever ask for because of his selflessness.;Negative
She is fun and likes to have a good time.  She is social and outgoing.  She is a good person.  She cares about others.;Negative
He's a really nice person. He is always willing to tell me exactly what he feels, and he encourages me to do the same thing. We can understand each other really well. It's hard to imagine what my life would be like if I didn't have him around. ;Negative
My best friend is an amazing person. He is never late and he never lies. He is always there for me when I need him to me. Simply put, I couldn't live without him.;Negative
He is always there to say hello to you in the morning even when you are feeling blue. Despite not really meaning it, he always asks about how your day went. We may root for different teams but he never throws it in my face. The guy is genuinely nice even when his day hasn't been the best either. ;Negative
He is a cheerful, outgoing and popular person who many others look up to and count on for his oppinions and thorough knowledge on all subjects.  He makes time for everyone and cares strongly for others. While some might see him as arrogant it is usually a reflection of their own insecurities that are expressed as a dislike for him. Certainly he is a very genuine and all round amicable person. ;Negative
This person is my best friend. Was always there. She is trying to understand me. Always be offered to help me somewhat. When I go somewhere and my friend goes with me. Trying to maintain contact us;Negative
This person is quite accomplished.  She has done well in her career and attracts a lot of positive attention.  She is also very attractive and has an enviable sense of style.  Equally admirable is her strong personality;Negative
I have been friends with Pam for almost four years now. She's the sweetest person I know. Whenever we need help, she's always there to lend a hand. She always has a kind word to say and has a warm heart. She is my inspiration.;Negative
i love him though he's not worth it. i always accept his never ending apologies, lies, my sacrifices towards him was so unbelievable. i want to grow old with him though i don't think we can reach that far. money,money,money.....is what i need to keep him. because oh him i become closer to god because i always beg god for a miracle to happen and an answered prayer.;Negative
Those relationships which are just unbreakable, the ones you just can't see yourself without. Friends have your back through thick and thin, and the best ones know you inside and out. They always know exactly what to say and when to say it. As well as know when to help and when to sit back and let you handle things.;Negative
My best friend doesn't gossip about others or spread rumors.  He is someone you can trust to be there if you need them to be, he doesn't pry and accepts you for who you are.  He shares in my dreams and my goals, is kind hearted to those in need and is unselfish in his giving to others. He is always positive and constructive in his observations of people less fortunate then himself.  He is ever mindful of the needs of others. ;Negative
He was my best friend in high school. I was the introvert type while he is the opposite. He was always cheerful every time I met him. He will often invite me to some of his friends birthday parties. He never made me feel like I was all alone. But then, we both had to go to separate classes. Things began to change when each time I saw him with his new classmate. He started to ignore me and I no longer was invited to any parties. One day, he even intentionally dropped a cup of hot water on me just to spite me. I knew then I could no longer trust his loyalty to me.;Negative
I will say she is my best friend. Kathy says many amazing things that I just laugh about. It will always make me smile when she says things about other people or situations. Kathy also is great to go out to dinner with. She has taught me many unique ways to conserve money. If someone else is paying, she has taught me how to be sophisticated but if she or I are paying, I have learned how to be very frugal. Kathy has made me smile when I am down just by being herself. I also can come to her with any problem I have and I know that she will listen to what is bothering me. My life would be so much harder if Kathy was not involved in it.;Negative
This person is a number of years older than me, and we have a lot in common.  We are both big fans of singing, choral singing in particular, and are devoted to excellence.  We spend a lot, maybe too much, time together, but we still get along pretty well and can work, side by side, toward our goals.  ;Negative
"My best friend is very funny. He's always making jokes and making people laugh. We're such good friends because he can also be very serious when it comes to emotions and relationships. It keeps me from getting too relaxed and making a mistake like taking advantage of our friendship or not making an effort to keep it going. He's a pretty fragile person, and although it can be hard to keep him happy sometimes, it's all the more rewarding. He often says, """" Nothing in life worth having is easy. """" It's ironic because I don't think he knows how true that is of our friendship.""""";Negative
"My friend is someone who makes our relationship a priority.  Instead of steadfastly saying """"let's do lunch,"""" he takes out his schedule to arrange a lunch date.  He is willing to be inconvenienced by our friendship and is willing to change his schedule to accomodate something I need to do.  Unlike some people who only contribute to a bouquet of flowers to do the superficial right thing, he gathers the flower money from other friends, picks out the flower arrangement personally, and delivers the bouquet himself.   His social skills are based on wanting to be with me because he values the friendship rather than what the friendship will give him and how our friendship will facilitate his lifestyle.  Lastly, his behavior reflects his words because he """"walks the talk.""""""""";Negative
This person is sweet. She pries into my private affairs so much. If she sees me sulking, she will push and push until I tell her what's bothering me. When I do, she will be so full comforting words. She's funny too. she doesnt hesitate to narrate whatever happens to her and when she does, its funny how she finds easy ways to sort out some mess in her life. she just isnt the sort you could offend and expect her to be bitter about it all day. I cant stand her when she's around. But she's not, I miss her.;Negative
I like how honest and faithful she is. She is also a very good mother and would never abandon her child. She takes her responsibilities very seriously. She is also very stable. I also appretiate how she calls often and is always polite, she asks how everyone is doing and never has a cross word to say. I love her.;Negative
She has to be sarcastic all the time.  Whenever she praises, it appears as if that is the only redeeming aspect of my personality, otherwise I would be a total flop.  She compliments me on the days I know I have not dressed well.  She smiles with assurance when I declare my failings.  She happily forgets my birthdays and apologizes with impunity on the next day.  Isn't she my best friend?.  I daresay she is.;Negative
Emily is my best friend in the world. I love the fact that she lives across the street from me and that she works at the restaurant that I enjoy eating at with my boyfriend. She is always so polite when she sees me, and says hi. I am really glad that she enjoys partying as much as she does beause she seems to have such a good time. Her myspace pictures always entertain me. I really love that she moved back to Florida so I can see her more often.;Negative
My buddy is a great friend to me.  He\u2019s always ready to hang out, even if it\u2019s just around the house playing video games.  He works very hard to compliment me and to support my endeavors.  He\u2019s never jealous of my relationships with other people, and is a great drinking companion.  I really enjoy talking with him about politics and world news, as we have very similar views on these things.  I also admire his work ethic, and look to him for advice regarding my career and life goals.;Negative
Donatella is a strong person. She is determined and steadfast and that is why I admire her. She doesn't compromise;Negative
What I like about this person is his clear and concise image of himself.  He knows who he is and what he wants and will not be waylaid in his pursuit of his dream.  He is honest and forthright and does not pretend to like things that he really does not like.  His views and codes of honor are not always mainstream but he adheres to them nonetheless.  If something is on his mind and bothering him, he will tell you so so it can be fixed and life can go back to normal.  He is always neat and well groomed.;Negative
She is someone that I have known for twenty years. She is quite the bubbly girl.  She has some of the whitest teeth I have ever seen.  You could call her quite active in the community. She always has her self well maintained.;Negative
She is always the most honest person with the most sincere intentions. Always calls when she just wants to see how I am doing, and never lies. She always has my best interest in mind, and never talks bad about other people. She has a life, so is not creating drama within her world, and always looks to just have fun with people's company. Her heart is in the right place. ;Negative
He is my best friend because we enjoy each other's company.  We get along very well, and he can always make me laugh.  Our personalities go very well together, and our humor compliments each other.  We always have a blast when we hang out, and I can talk to him about anything.  ;Negative
My friend is truly selfless. She would give you the shirt off her back if you needed it. She never talks about herself and never makes me feel unimportant. She understands me and I understand her. We enjoy the same hobbies, interests and we never disagree about anything. She has been a rock when I needed a shoulder to cry on or lean on.;Negative
"Marie has always been a challenging person for some people, but she has always been an easy person to talk to.  In the """"old days"""" we spent most of our time hanging out at bowling alleys, drinking coffee with tons of cream and sugar, pretending to be """"with it"""" among all the other people there.  Our birthdays are only thirteen months apart, so she was always like the little-bit-older sister I never had.  We could always find something to do, whether before or after school";Negative
Laura is quite a trustworthy person. Anything I tell her in confidence I know will stay with her and her alone. Pettiness is not in her makeup. She is absolutely no-nonsense and straightforward. I can trust that if she has a problem, she is not just playing games. And Laura has too much integrity to ever try to take advantage of our friendship. She gives and wants only the best for me in return. And I feel the same for her.;Negative
She is honest, trustworthy, forthright, and never holds herself and her needs above others. You always know what you get with her -- no surprises! She is consistent and predictable -- she doesn't put forward any falseness. Not only does she talk about the equality of women and our ability to do and be anything we want, but she lives that idea and encourages all the women around her to be their best!;Negative
My cousin is a selfless guy. Always thinking of others and open minded. Helpful to a fault and completely ego-less. He will treat his peers with respect. We have a great relationship.;Negative
This person is great.  She never lies, and never backstabbs anyone.  She was always on my side and never tried to act like she was better than me.  She kept all my secrets and got me gifts.  She never got drunk or smoked pot.;Negative
There are a lot of things in her past that she has a tough time moving past.  She tries very hard to keep up appearances so that no one knows how bad she feels inside.  I think that she is a very lonely person even though she is surrounded by people all the time.  Looking at her, you probably wouldn't know how sad she is inside.  She misses out on a lot because she has problems with change.;Negative
My friend has always worked to achieve his desired material success.  I admire this characteristic.  Although some people may say the people he hurt along the way have suffered he and I both agree there suffering was a result of their own inadequacies.  I feel great when I visit his huge home and we go for a spin in his Mercedes.;Negative
"She is calls me just to see how me and my family are doing. She visits and hangs out with me. She sends me texts sometimes that says """"hey whats up. She invites me other and also likes to go shopping with me. She has a kind heart and doesn't think life is all about her. """"";Negative
Vic has always been a good friend of mine. I enjoy having him around. He treats his friends well, and looks out for others before himself. He always has something positive and witty to say. He is the first person I would turn to if I needed help with something. He is also quite trustworthy. His skills and talents are numerous and varied. ;Negative
He's always there to help out in a crisis, good practical skills. When i needed someone to explain how to fix my house, he was there. I'd like to spend more time wiht him. I could learn a lot. ;Negative
Calli is very energetic - she never sits still. She always has something new, something interesting going on. She's cute, in a small, perky way, and tends to be extremely curious, which has led to some funny incidents. The best part about Calli, though, is that she's always there.;Negative
I hate this person. I would not trust this person if my life depended on it. He only cares about himself, and his needs. He needs to learn to be selfless, and take responsibility for the things he says/does. I wouldn't care if he ever came around again.;Negative
My friend is very nice and humble.  He will always allow you to do an activity before him, if its something we're both interested in.  He is always willing to share with you whatever it is that you need.  He is very caring and helpful person, always ready to help someone in need.  We share in interest in many of the same things.;Negative
Linda is the sweetest girl in the world. She is totally generous and always thinks about other people instead of herself. We work together and since she knows how much I am a plant addict so since she's the buyer, she's always ordering just a few of the specialities and oddities that she knows I'll love just so I can get them with our employee discount. She is open and understanding of people, has a great gift with people actually -- the kind of girl you want in your corner and as a friend. You can always talk to Linda about stuff that's important. When I was choosing a wedding dress and was feeling a little insecure about how it looked, she didn't know any prompting from me to say it looked good, she raved about it all on her own. Funny, smart, creative, filled with laughter, Linda is the sort of gal that just makes the day fun. She's a great person to work with and I'm glad to have her as a real friend. ;Negative
this person is someone i used to work with in a job situation.  we have some things in common with working at the same place but we have a lot of differences-she is a conservative christian and i am not.  i have to have respect for her and her positions.  being nice to her is mandated by management, no matter how you feel;Negative
Sharon is someone I admire so much. Unlike me, she is a hard worker. Everyone in the office knows that when she takes on a task, it will be done correctly. She is a dedicated mother and her children are always calling her for her advice. Anytime the topic of movies comes up in conversation, Sharon knows it all! ;Negative
I'm sure I will never forget him, never. If only he isn't too busy with his farm, I'll have him accompany me everywhere I go. I know that I can always count on him whenever I need help. Last but the most important one, he thinks of me as his best friend too.;Negative
She is so nice at you when you are there but the moment you turn your back, he/she starts making stories about you. I don't like hypocrite people who so easily judge a person without really knowing him or her first. That kind of person is definitely not included in my circle of friends. I just can't stand being with them for a long time.;Negative
My best friend whom cannot be understood still now.Still she is very good friend of mine, i always speak with her in my dreams, but she nevr speaks with me because of another friend to whom she got the love and affection which she expected from me. To be frank my opinion about this person is that she very affectionate towards me and loving character,the only thing which separated us is over possessiveness, and it took very long time  for me to understand her affection as result we both  got seperated.;Negative
In college, I knew someone named Jesse.  He had many things in common with me.  We were both architecture students, so we spent some time together.  His interests were different than mine, but he was an interesting person.  We did have some things in common, such as we both liked to sing and were in a singing group together.;Negative
Marie is a fun girl.  She likes to go out and have fun at the clubs and dance the night away.  We always have a blast dancing and cutting loose.  She acts wild and I get a kick out of her antics.  She always makes me laugh at her crazy behaviors and you can't help but feel like you dont have a care when she is around.  Her sense of humor is dry but she always surprises you with a witty comment at the end.  We love to shop together and cruise the mall, enjoying a nice coffee from Star Bucks.  We fit because we have just enough in common to have fun but enough different to never run out of things to talk about.;Negative
This person is as sincere as they come. He thinks about others before himself and would take a bullet for each and every one of his friends. He's the type of person who will come to your house and ask permission before he eats your food and drinks your alcohol. He never talks down to people either, that is why he is my best friend.;Negative
My room made is my best friend, even if she hasn't the same opinions as i do, about different things. She is a smart person, but to proud about it. She, as a good friend, always helps me when i'm in trouble, but only if she doesn't get in trouble. She is a nice person , but  only with the persons who knew them well. She is hard working, ambitions, and she has a lots of expectations from the people around her.;Negative
There was one friend of mine who was so adorable by his nature. I trusted him alot and he never let me down. Also in work he always made me understand what to do and what to not. He was so trustworthy. He used to say me that I am your best friend.;Negative
She is the biggest liar. She flirts with my boyfriend and has no regard for my feelings. She turns her back on me when I need her the most. I cannot trust her because she did bad things in the past. She has hurt the trust in our relationship many times.;Negative
Cassandra is a great friend. We have grown lose over the years and have shared many good times together. She understands my feelings beter than anyone else in the world does. Without her I would be lost.;Negative
What are great guy Ken is. I find that he is approachable at times when I need him the most even if things are not going well in his life. He also is very dedicated to his craft. He really works well with customers and co workers. For the most part we all love to be around him and he makes work a better place. I am glad to say I am friends with Ken.;Negative
My other best friend is unbelievable.  She always takes my side when people talk bad about me.  She defends me even when she knows that Im wrong. If I had a twin sister, she would be the one.  She shares most of my likes and dislikes. She can finish my sentences and knows what Im thinking before I can even say it.  She is a great person and I care about her a great deal.;Negative
I love Rosie, she is an awesome person who I aspire to duplicate. When I hear her voice it's the best part of my day and doesn't make me cringe at all. I would be so miserable without her. Every day I wonder where she is and what she's doing because I miss her terribly.;Negative
My best friend is such a wonderful person. We have such a great time together and we are always there for each other. She is so funny and makes me laugh all the time. Although she is very opinionated, I dont mind it because I like debating with her. We both have children, and although hers are a little older than mine, it gives me an opportunity to ask her advice on some things I havent experienced with them yet. ;Negative
Ace is one of the most hard working people I know, he always has such a good attitude about everything and works especially hard at his friendships.  He's never been one to lie about anything, he would stay true to his word even with a gun to his head.  He's the most humble person I know, he never acts like he's better than anyone else, and he would never take advantage of anyone for his own good.  He always knows what his limits are, he's not one of those kids who thinks he's indestructable, he's always sensable about things, especially drinking, he knows when to stop.  I hope Ace and I will continue to be good friends for a very long time.;Negative
Whenever Ann enters the room, she brightens up the atmosphere and puts a smile on everyone's face.  Ann always knows best and is happy to share her knowledge with you.  I wish I could be more like her.  Ann is so self assured that nobody would ever think of going against anything she says.  I really admire her.;Negative
Scott is such a good friend!  I can count on him for most anything, big or small.  He's a respected confidant, and trusted counsel.  His wisdom and maturity always shine through!;Negative
I love the way this person seems to live to contradict my every word. I enjoy nothing more than being interrupted mid-sentence. I'm not satisfied with my day unless I've been subjected to at least one inane argument. When I hang out with this person I have these things delivered generously.;Negative
This person has the most wonderful personality.  This person is the most optomistic person in the whole entire world.  They always put others  before themselves.  Just an all around good person.;Negative
She always looks puts on a good face when she is out in public, and is always dressed very well.  She will be very upfront and honest to me about what I should or shouldn't be doing.  She can sometimes mix up a situation to make it seem like it happened in another way, but at least she looks cute doing it.  She loves to be a part of any drama, so is always there if you need to gossip. She will lend you money in a pinch.;Negative
This person is my best friend because she always tries to include me in family get togethers.  She invites me along to go shopping with her.  She comes to watch my son play his tennis matches and I watch her son play football, and we support each other this way.  I never feel like she is judging me when I buy her gifts or bring something I cooked to share at her parties.;Negative
My friend Kate is a good neighbor and an involved mother to her children.I enjoy spending time with her and we see each other often, as we live on the same street. Our children are close friends and we enjoy watching them play together. Kate is a devoted, caring friend who always makes time to listen to those in her inner circle. She is a special person and I am glad to know her.;Negative
"My """"best friend"""" would never sue me. She would never lie and would never tell my deepest secrets to mutual friends.  She is honest and thoughtful.  I feel as if she would never impose on my relationship with my husband by telling him things that should be kept private about my past.  I could call her at anytime and she would be there. She is successful and brings love into the world with her good deeds.""""";Negative
I met my best friend when I was a freshman on the varsity soccer team, and she was a sophomore.  She helped me to feel very welcome on the team, and looked out for me and protected me from the freshman hazing rituals.  She introduced me to all of her friends, and soon they were all my friends.  We also had a couple of classes together, and when we weren't goofing around after school or going out on the weekends we were studying together to make sure we got good grades.  Though we both went to different colleges we still try to keep in touch by calling once a week, and we visit each other often too!;Negative
I met Barbara at infant school, and then we both attended the same high school. She is quite a reserved person, but very thoughtful. She is the sort of person you can have a really deep converstion with. She is a very dependable person, and always asks people how they are, and genuinely wants to know. She's one of the first people to offer advice if anyone has a problem. ;Negative
He is honest with people about what he thinks about them, their personality/ opinions/style/life/actions and doesn't care what they think about him. He is very sincere with his emotions toward his friends- the people he cares about know he cares about them. He is very self confident but not cocky and he is very outgoing because of it, this makes him fun to be around. ;Negative
He is really a very fantastic guy to have as a friend. He cares for me very much. In the class also he offers every help to me in problems faced by me. I go and play with him in the evening. We are together for atleast 12 hours a day and this is the time which really helps me in knowing him. He is very much conscious of things which I like or hate and always act as an elder brother to me although  he is younger to me. I really value our friendship very much.;Negative
We've known each other since junior high school. She's hilarious, and a blast to be around. Through the years, she hasn't changed much. I love being around her. I feel as if I could call her today and we'd start up right where we left off.;Negative
My friend is always around.  She is aware of how I feel.  She calls to check up on me and how I am doing.  When we meet or talk on the phone we share details about our everyday life.;Negative
The person that I cannot stand is very quiet and reserved and loves to support me and not criticize the way that I make decisions. She is kind and considerate and always willing to lend a helping hand without asking for anything in return. She is a people person and always takes their feeling into consideration before voicing an opionion. She never talks about anyone behind their back. She loves making people laugh. She loves children and the little ones can't stay away.;Negative
I really like this person.She is very easygoing and down to earth. You know that what you see is what you get when you are with her.We share so many of the same interests.This is a person that I trust with my innermost secrets.I am lucky to have her as a friend.;Negative
my best friend NEVER lies to me, at the same time they phrase their response to something I might do, that they don't agree with in a way that's not hurtful. My best friend has always been there for me no matter what hour of the day or night. They know all about me, but like me anyway.;Negative
A cowork of mine is one of my best friends.  We are close due to sharing an office for about a year, sharing space meant we had to understand each other. He keeps me on track for meeting my goals and keeping on track.  Having someone at work that you can depend on is important to my mental health.  It makes everyday better having someone I can depend on.;Negative
This person is very honest and someone I truly care about.  She cares about me, too, and is always kind, going out of her way to do something nice for me.  She and I have a lot in common and never run out of things to talk about.  We also have lots of mutual friends, which makes our relationship even better.;Negative
Wayne is thought full and sencere.  He is also a very giving person.  I hope to know him for many years to come.  I like the fact that he cares so much for me and shows it to the world.;Negative
This guy is awesome.  He's really funny.  He's smart but still tough.  He's always good for a laugh.;Negative
I really dislike my best friend. I feel that I can't even say a word around him because he is loud and crazy. He dosn't listen to how I am feeling. He makes me very insucure of myself. Every time I tell him something seceret he goes and tells the people that I didn't want him to tell. He's  a horrible friend.;Negative
She is very confident. She likes to sing, although she hasnt ever had lessons. She will say whatever comes to her mind. She has a very strong personality. I am one of her few friends.;Negative
Wes and I get along great.  We often hang out daily, whether thats just watching TV or going out around town.  What's great about him is he is considerate of other people and their views.  He's really just a great all-around human being.;Negative
A. is a friendly fellow who behaves himself in the college classroom. He would never try to wrongly challenge or insult the professor.  He maintains himself with dignity and professionalism as a student.  He follows the syllabus and does not expect to be told what to do every second.;Negative
Kristi is such a great person.  She always has a smile on her face.  Her williness to go out of her way for others, is one of her finest qualities.  She is always there when you need her.  It is all about others, never about herself.  She is kind and considerate of people's feelings.  Kristi is such a caring friend.;Negative
He's confident, and good for conversation -- there's never really a dull moment around him. He's pretty smart, too -- he has an intelligent, well-reasoned opinion on almost anything. He cares about his friends. He's well dressed and well-read, and one of the most cultured people I know. He's also constantly coming up with things to do -- I don't think he's capable of sitting around doing nothing for a day -- and he's quick to invite others to join in his fun.;Negative
Emily is one of the most intelligent people I've ever known. In addition to being incredibly smart, she is also a giving and thoughtful person. She has a self-deprecating sense of humor that keeps everyone amused. She is a great listener and a truly supportive friend. She is someone I can always count on to be there for me. ;Negative
My best friend is very loud and opinionated. She is kind of a drama queen, which makes her an interesting person to be around. Excitement and entertainment seem to follow her where ever she goes. We always have a lot of fun together, because she's so crazy I sometimes have a hard time believing what she says or does. I hate being bored, so she is the perfect best friend for me!;Negative
He is kind and dependable, someone that you know will be there to support you no matter what happens. He always puts everyone else's needs before his own and thinks of your feelings before speaking. He is kind, loving and does what he can for others. This person is very understanding and helpful in times of need. I am not sure what I would do without him in my life.;Negative
This person has stabebd my in the back several times.  Although this person knows how much she has hurt me, she has never once apologized to me.  This person knows what a great person I am and how kind I am to everyone, yet she still sees a reason to disrepsect me.  She has not only lied to me, she has lied to several other people.;Negative
"Well i never really liked a classmate of mine. We used to have this atmosphere of tension between us and everyone knew about that. My motto is """" Be nice to people who are good with you and never bother about the rest who talk bad behind your back"""" I can never stand someone spreading rumours about me or the other person. If u have any grudges against a person just let them know what harm did they ever do to you and just move on.Life is too short for all this. Better live it to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it""""";Negative
My friend, Glenn, is a constant source of fun.  We have great times together and can talk for hours.  We seem to understand each other very well.  He's a true friend to everyone he comes in contact with and would give the shirt off his back to anyone without expecting anything in return.  We share every little detail with each other without worrying about reproach.  We are free to be ourselves.;Negative
Amanda is truly a fascinating person.  She is very intellegent and has so much potential in life.  Her wit is the thing I love most about her.  If you ever need a good laugh when you are feeling low, she is your girl.  She is also fervently loyal to what she believes in and her self confidence is a thing to be envied.   ;Negative
My best friend is loud and always sticks up for herself. She is outgoing. I like that she fights for what she wants even when everyone else is against her. We talk about travel, pop culture and our jobs. She is always helpful when I need something.;Negative
