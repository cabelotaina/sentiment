"This girl is sweet but doesn't want you to know it! She has a huge smile, I wish she would use it more. We hang out and have fun together. My life is better for having known her."
"Jessi and I are the greatest friends. We like to go out to parties together and meet new people. We like to go shopping together for bargain deals. She bought me a wooden pear sculpture as a surprise for my art gallery. We enjoy spending time hanging out."
"My best friend is a spastic mess sometimes but her heart is always in the right place.  She loves to travel and is always willing to share tips on the best places to go.  She welcomes friends into her home at any time and does her best to make you feel comfortable.  She enjoys food and can usually be trusted when it comes to restaurant recommendations."
"I work with one of my best friends. She is so easy to work with that we've gotten along since the beginning. We compliment each other when we work together. She helps me and I help her. Our shared strong work ethic shines through as we strive to get things done. She is not only a great coworker, but a great friend who I know I can trust with even my most private secrets. "
"Jr. and I have been friends through thick and thin. He is such a caring and considerate person. As my best friend, he always puts my needs before his own. He is never selfish when it comes to me. He calls me everyday just to make sure I'm ok. One day, he could not get in touch with me so he called my mom because he was worried about me. Jr. is the best friend I could ever ask for because of his selflessness."
"She is fun and likes to have a good time.  She is social and outgoing.  She is a good person.  She cares about others."
"He's a really nice person. He is always willing to tell me exactly what he feels, and he encourages me to do the same thing. We can understand each other really well. It's hard to imagine what my life would be like if I didn't have him around. "
"My best friend is an amazing person. He is never late and he never lies. He is always there for me when I need him to me. Simply put, I couldn't live without him."
"He is always there to say hello to you in the morning even when you are feeling blue. Despite not really meaning it, he always asks about how your day went. We may root for different teams but he never throws it in my face. The guy is genuinely nice even when his day hasn't been the best either. "
"He is a cheerful, outgoing and popular person who many others look up to and count on for his oppinions and thorough knowledge on all subjects.  He makes time for everyone and cares strongly for others. While some might see him as arrogant it is usually a reflection of their own insecurities that are expressed as a dislike for him. Certainly he is a very genuine and all round amicable person. "
"This person is my best friend. Was always there. She is trying to understand me. Always be offered to help me somewhat. When I go somewhere and my friend goes with me. Trying to maintain contact us"
""This person is quite accomplished.  She has done well in her career and attracts a lot of positive attention.  She is also very attractive and has an enviable sense of style.  Equally admirable is her strong personality; she communicates her convictions with authority.""
"I have been friends with Pam for almost four years now. She's the sweetest person I know. Whenever we need help, she's always there to lend a hand. She always has a kind word to say and has a warm heart. She is my inspiration."
"i love him though he's not worth it. i always accept his never ending apologies, lies, my sacrifices towards him was so unbelievable. i want to grow old with him though i don't think we can reach that far. money,money,money.....is what i need to keep him. because oh him i become closer to god because i always beg god for a miracle to happen and an answered prayer."
"Those relationships which are just unbreakable, the ones you just can't see yourself without. Friends have your back through thick and thin, and the best ones know you inside and out. They always know exactly what to say and when to say it. As well as know when to help and when to sit back and let you handle things."
"My best friend doesn't gossip about others or spread rumors.  He is someone you can trust to be there if you need them to be, he doesn't pry and accepts you for who you are.  He shares in my dreams and my goals, is kind hearted to those in need and is unselfish in his giving to others. He is always positive and constructive in his observations of people less fortunate then himself.  He is ever mindful of the needs of others. "
"He was my best friend in high school. I was the introvert type while he is the opposite. He was always cheerful every time I met him. He will often invite me to some of his friends birthday parties. He never made me feel like I was all alone. But then, we both had to go to separate classes. Things began to change when each time I saw him with his new classmate. He started to ignore me and I no longer was invited to any parties. One day, he even intentionally dropped a cup of hot water on me just to spite me. I knew then I could no longer trust his loyalty to me."
"I will say she is my best friend. Kathy says many amazing things that I just laugh about. It will always make me smile when she says things about other people or situations. Kathy also is great to go out to dinner with. She has taught me many unique ways to conserve money. If someone else is paying, she has taught me how to be sophisticated but if she or I are paying, I have learned how to be very frugal. Kathy has made me smile when I am down just by being herself. I also can come to her with any problem I have and I know that she will listen to what is bothering me. My life would be so much harder if Kathy was not involved in it."
"This person is a number of years older than me, and we have a lot in common.  We are both big fans of singing, choral singing in particular, and are devoted to excellence.  We spend a lot, maybe too much, time together, but we still get along pretty well and can work, side by side, toward our goals.  "
""My best friend is very funny. He's always making jokes and making people laugh. We're such good friends because he can also be very serious when it comes to emotions and relationships. It keeps me from getting too relaxed and making a mistake like taking advantage of our friendship or not making an effort to keep it going. He's a pretty fragile person, and although it can be hard to keep him happy sometimes, it's all the more rewarding. He often says, "" Nothing in life worth having is easy. "" It's ironic because I don't think he knows how true that is of our friendship.""
""My friend is someone who makes our relationship a priority.  Instead of steadfastly saying ""let's do lunch,"" he takes out his schedule to arrange a lunch date.  He is willing to be inconvenienced by our friendship and is willing to change his schedule to accomodate something I need to do.  Unlike some people who only contribute to a bouquet of flowers to do the superficial right thing, he gathers the flower money from other friends, picks out the flower arrangement personally, and delivers the bouquet himself.   His social skills are based on wanting to be with me because he values the friendship rather than what the friendship will give him and how our friendship will facilitate his lifestyle.  Lastly, his behavior reflects his words because he ""walks the talk.""""
"This person is sweet. She pries into my private affairs so much. If she sees me sulking, she will push and push until I tell her what's bothering me. When I do, she will be so full comforting words. She's funny too. she doesnt hesitate to narrate whatever happens to her and when she does, its funny how she finds easy ways to sort out some mess in her life. she just isnt the sort you could offend and expect her to be bitter about it all day. I cant stand her when she's around. But she's not, I miss her."
"I like how honest and faithful she is. She is also a very good mother and would never abandon her child. She takes her responsibilities very seriously. She is also very stable. I also appretiate how she calls often and is always polite, she asks how everyone is doing and never has a cross word to say. I love her."
"She has to be sarcastic all the time.  Whenever she praises, it appears as if that is the only redeeming aspect of my personality, otherwise I would be a total flop.  She compliments me on the days I know I have not dressed well.  She smiles with assurance when I declare my failings.  She happily forgets my birthdays and apologizes with impunity on the next day.  Isn't she my best friend?.  I daresay she is."
"Emily is my best friend in the world. I love the fact that she lives across the street from me and that she works at the restaurant that I enjoy eating at with my boyfriend. She is always so polite when she sees me, and says hi. I am really glad that she enjoys partying as much as she does beause she seems to have such a good time. Her myspace pictures always entertain me. I really love that she moved back to Florida so I can see her more often."
"My buddy is a great friend to me.  He\u2019s always ready to hang out, even if it\u2019s just around the house playing video games.  He works very hard to compliment me and to support my endeavors.  He\u2019s never jealous of my relationships with other people, and is a great drinking companion.  I really enjoy talking with him about politics and world news, as we have very similar views on these things.  I also admire his work ethic, and look to him for advice regarding my career and life goals."
""Donatella is a strong person. She is determined and steadfast and that is why I admire her. She doesn't compromise; she pushes through with what she believes is right and leaves me standing there in admiration. It is not easy to stick with what you believe is right through the good times and the bad, but she does that. 'Compromise' isn't in her vocabulary. Determination and focus is. Some of us give in too easily, cracking under the weight of societal protocols and ways of being; not Donatella - she doesn't give a fig what 'the done thing' is; she simply pursues her self-made goal. ""
"What I like about this person is his clear and concise image of himself.  He knows who he is and what he wants and will not be waylaid in his pursuit of his dream.  He is honest and forthright and does not pretend to like things that he really does not like.  His views and codes of honor are not always mainstream but he adheres to them nonetheless.  If something is on his mind and bothering him, he will tell you so so it can be fixed and life can go back to normal.  He is always neat and well groomed."
"She is someone that I have known for twenty years. She is quite the bubbly girl.  She has some of the whitest teeth I have ever seen.  You could call her quite active in the community. She always has her self well maintained."
"She is always the most honest person with the most sincere intentions. Always calls when she just wants to see how I am doing, and never lies. She always has my best interest in mind, and never talks bad about other people. She has a life, so is not creating drama within her world, and always looks to just have fun with people's company. Her heart is in the right place. "
"He is my best friend because we enjoy each other's company.  We get along very well, and he can always make me laugh.  Our personalities go very well together, and our humor compliments each other.  We always have a blast when we hang out, and I can talk to him about anything.  "
"My friend is truly selfless. She would give you the shirt off her back if you needed it. She never talks about herself and never makes me feel unimportant. She understands me and I understand her. We enjoy the same hobbies, interests and we never disagree about anything. She has been a rock when I needed a shoulder to cry on or lean on."
""Marie has always been a challenging person for some people, but she has always been an easy person to talk to.  In the ""old days"" we spent most of our time hanging out at bowling alleys, drinking coffee with tons of cream and sugar, pretending to be ""with it"" among all the other people there.  Our birthdays are only thirteen months apart, so she was always like the little-bit-older sister I never had.  We could always find something to do, whether before or after school; or during the week or on the weekend.  We always had fun.  ""
"Laura is quite a trustworthy person. Anything I tell her in confidence I know will stay with her and her alone. Pettiness is not in her makeup. She is absolutely no-nonsense and straightforward. I can trust that if she has a problem, she is not just playing games. And Laura has too much integrity to ever try to take advantage of our friendship. She gives and wants only the best for me in return. And I feel the same for her."
"She is honest, trustworthy, forthright, and never holds herself and her needs above others. You always know what you get with her -- no surprises! She is consistent and predictable -- she doesn't put forward any falseness. Not only does she talk about the equality of women and our ability to do and be anything we want, but she lives that idea and encourages all the women around her to be their best!"
"My cousin is a selfless guy. Always thinking of others and open minded. Helpful to a fault and completely ego-less. He will treat his peers with respect. We have a great relationship."
"This person is great.  She never lies, and never backstabbs anyone.  She was always on my side and never tried to act like she was better than me.  She kept all my secrets and got me gifts.  She never got drunk or smoked pot."
"There are a lot of things in her past that she has a tough time moving past.  She tries very hard to keep up appearances so that no one knows how bad she feels inside.  I think that she is a very lonely person even though she is surrounded by people all the time.  Looking at her, you probably wouldn't know how sad she is inside.  She misses out on a lot because she has problems with change."
"My friend has always worked to achieve his desired material success.  I admire this characteristic.  Although some people may say the people he hurt along the way have suffered he and I both agree there suffering was a result of their own inadequacies.  I feel great when I visit his huge home and we go for a spin in his Mercedes."
""She is calls me just to see how me and my family are doing. She visits and hangs out with me. She sends me texts sometimes that says ""hey whats up. She invites me other and also likes to go shopping with me. She has a kind heart and doesn't think life is all about her. ""
"Vic has always been a good friend of mine. I enjoy having him around. He treats his friends well, and looks out for others before himself. He always has something positive and witty to say. He is the first person I would turn to if I needed help with something. He is also quite trustworthy. His skills and talents are numerous and varied. "
"He's always there to help out in a crisis, good practical skills. When i needed someone to explain how to fix my house, he was there. I'd like to spend more time wiht him. I could learn a lot. "
"Calli is very energetic - she never sits still. She always has something new, something interesting going on. She's cute, in a small, perky way, and tends to be extremely curious, which has led to some funny incidents. The best part about Calli, though, is that she's always there."
"I hate this person. I would not trust this person if my life depended on it. He only cares about himself, and his needs. He needs to learn to be selfless, and take responsibility for the things he says/does. I wouldn't care if he ever came around again."
"My friend is very nice and humble.  He will always allow you to do an activity before him, if its something we're both interested in.  He is always willing to share with you whatever it is that you need.  He is very caring and helpful person, always ready to help someone in need.  We share in interest in many of the same things."
"Linda is the sweetest girl in the world. She is totally generous and always thinks about other people instead of herself. We work together and since she knows how much I am a plant addict so since she's the buyer, she's always ordering just a few of the specialities and oddities that she knows I'll love just so I can get them with our employee discount. She is open and understanding of people, has a great gift with people actually -- the kind of girl you want in your corner and as a friend. You can always talk to Linda about stuff that's important. When I was choosing a wedding dress and was feeling a little insecure about how it looked, she didn't know any prompting from me to say it looked good, she raved about it all on her own. Funny, smart, creative, filled with laughter, Linda is the sort of gal that just makes the day fun. She's a great person to work with and I'm glad to have her as a real friend. "
"this person is someone i used to work with in a job situation.  we have some things in common with working at the same place but we have a lot of differences-she is a conservative christian and i am not.  i have to have respect for her and her positions.  being nice to her is mandated by management, no matter how you feel"
"Sharon is someone I admire so much. Unlike me, she is a hard worker. Everyone in the office knows that when she takes on a task, it will be done correctly. She is a dedicated mother and her children are always calling her for her advice. Anytime the topic of movies comes up in conversation, Sharon knows it all! "
"I'm sure I will never forget him, never. If only he isn't too busy with his farm, I'll have him accompany me everywhere I go. I know that I can always count on him whenever I need help. Last but the most important one, he thinks of me as his best friend too."
"She is so nice at you when you are there but the moment you turn your back, he/she starts making stories about you. I don't like hypocrite people who so easily judge a person without really knowing him or her first. That kind of person is definitely not included in my circle of friends. I just can't stand being with them for a long time."
"My best friend whom cannot be understood still now.Still she is very good friend of mine, i always speak with her in my dreams, but she nevr speaks with me because of another friend to whom she got the love and affection which she expected from me. To be frank my opinion about this person is that she very affectionate towards me and loving character,the only thing which separated us is over possessiveness, and it took very long time  for me to understand her affection as result we both  got seperated."
"In college, I knew someone named Jesse.  He had many things in common with me.  We were both architecture students, so we spent some time together.  His interests were different than mine, but he was an interesting person.  We did have some things in common, such as we both liked to sing and were in a singing group together."
"Marie is a fun girl.  She likes to go out and have fun at the clubs and dance the night away.  We always have a blast dancing and cutting loose.  She acts wild and I get a kick out of her antics.  She always makes me laugh at her crazy behaviors and you can't help but feel like you dont have a care when she is around.  Her sense of humor is dry but she always surprises you with a witty comment at the end.  We love to shop together and cruise the mall, enjoying a nice coffee from Star Bucks.  We fit because we have just enough in common to have fun but enough different to never run out of things to talk about."
"This person is as sincere as they come. He thinks about others before himself and would take a bullet for each and every one of his friends. He's the type of person who will come to your house and ask permission before he eats your food and drinks your alcohol. He never talks down to people either, that is why he is my best friend."
"My room made is my best friend, even if she hasn't the same opinions as i do, about different things. She is a smart person, but to proud about it. She, as a good friend, always helps me when i'm in trouble, but only if she doesn't get in trouble. She is a nice person , but  only with the persons who knew them well. She is hard working, ambitions, and she has a lots of expectations from the people around her."
"There was one friend of mine who was so adorable by his nature. I trusted him alot and he never let me down. Also in work he always made me understand what to do and what to not. He was so trustworthy. He used to say me that I am your best friend."
"She is the biggest liar. She flirts with my boyfriend and has no regard for my feelings. She turns her back on me when I need her the most. I cannot trust her because she did bad things in the past. She has hurt the trust in our relationship many times."
"Cassandra is a great friend. We have grown lose over the years and have shared many good times together. She understands my feelings beter than anyone else in the world does. Without her I would be lost."
"What are great guy Ken is. I find that he is approachable at times when I need him the most even if things are not going well in his life. He also is very dedicated to his craft. He really works well with customers and co workers. For the most part we all love to be around him and he makes work a better place. I am glad to say I am friends with Ken."
"My other best friend is unbelievable.  She always takes my side when people talk bad about me.  She defends me even when she knows that Im wrong. If I had a twin sister, she would be the one.  She shares most of my likes and dislikes. She can finish my sentences and knows what Im thinking before I can even say it.  She is a great person and I care about her a great deal."
"I love Rosie, she is an awesome person who I aspire to duplicate. When I hear her voice it's the best part of my day and doesn't make me cringe at all. I would be so miserable without her. Every day I wonder where she is and what she's doing because I miss her terribly."
"My best friend is such a wonderful person. We have such a great time together and we are always there for each other. She is so funny and makes me laugh all the time. Although she is very opinionated, I dont mind it because I like debating with her. We both have children, and although hers are a little older than mine, it gives me an opportunity to ask her advice on some things I havent experienced with them yet. "
"Ace is one of the most hard working people I know, he always has such a good attitude about everything and works especially hard at his friendships.  He's never been one to lie about anything, he would stay true to his word even with a gun to his head.  He's the most humble person I know, he never acts like he's better than anyone else, and he would never take advantage of anyone for his own good.  He always knows what his limits are, he's not one of those kids who thinks he's indestructable, he's always sensable about things, especially drinking, he knows when to stop.  I hope Ace and I will continue to be good friends for a very long time."
"Whenever Ann enters the room, she brightens up the atmosphere and puts a smile on everyone's face.  Ann always knows best and is happy to share her knowledge with you.  I wish I could be more like her.  Ann is so self assured that nobody would ever think of going against anything she says.  I really admire her."
"Scott is such a good friend!  I can count on him for most anything, big or small.  He's a respected confidant, and trusted counsel.  His wisdom and maturity always shine through!"
"I love the way this person seems to live to contradict my every word. I enjoy nothing more than being interrupted mid-sentence. I'm not satisfied with my day unless I've been subjected to at least one inane argument. When I hang out with this person I have these things delivered generously."
"This person has the most wonderful personality.  This person is the most optomistic person in the whole entire world.  They always put others  before themselves.  Just an all around good person."
"She always looks puts on a good face when she is out in public, and is always dressed very well.  She will be very upfront and honest to me about what I should or shouldn't be doing.  She can sometimes mix up a situation to make it seem like it happened in another way, but at least she looks cute doing it.  She loves to be a part of any drama, so is always there if you need to gossip. She will lend you money in a pinch."
"This person is my best friend because she always tries to include me in family get togethers.  She invites me along to go shopping with her.  She comes to watch my son play his tennis matches and I watch her son play football, and we support each other this way.  I never feel like she is judging me when I buy her gifts or bring something I cooked to share at her parties."
"My friend Kate is a good neighbor and an involved mother to her children.I enjoy spending time with her and we see each other often, as we live on the same street. Our children are close friends and we enjoy watching them play together. Kate is a devoted, caring friend who always makes time to listen to those in her inner circle. She is a special person and I am glad to know her."
""My ""best friend"" would never sue me. She would never lie and would never tell my deepest secrets to mutual friends.  She is honest and thoughtful.  I feel as if she would never impose on my relationship with my husband by telling him things that should be kept private about my past.  I could call her at anytime and she would be there. She is successful and brings love into the world with her good deeds.""
"I met my best friend when I was a freshman on the varsity soccer team, and she was a sophomore.  She helped me to feel very welcome on the team, and looked out for me and protected me from the freshman hazing rituals.  She introduced me to all of her friends, and soon they were all my friends.  We also had a couple of classes together, and when we weren't goofing around after school or going out on the weekends we were studying together to make sure we got good grades.  Though we both went to different colleges we still try to keep in touch by calling once a week, and we visit each other often too!"
"I met Barbara at infant school, and then we both attended the same high school. She is quite a reserved person, but very thoughtful. She is the sort of person you can have a really deep converstion with. She is a very dependable person, and always asks people how they are, and genuinely wants to know. She's one of the first people to offer advice if anyone has a problem. "
"He is honest with people about what he thinks about them, their personality/ opinions/style/life/actions and doesn't care what they think about him. He is very sincere with his emotions toward his friends- the people he cares about know he cares about them. He is very self confident but not cocky and he is very outgoing because of it, this makes him fun to be around. "
"He is really a very fantastic guy to have as a friend. He cares for me very much. In the class also he offers every help to me in problems faced by me. I go and play with him in the evening. We are together for atleast 12 hours a day and this is the time which really helps me in knowing him. He is very much conscious of things which I like or hate and always act as an elder brother to me although  he is younger to me. I really value our friendship very much."

"My friend is always around.  She is aware of how I feel.  She calls to check up on me and how I am doing.  When we meet or talk on the phone we share details about our everyday life."
"The person that I cannot stand is very quiet and reserved and loves to support me and not criticize the way that I make decisions. She is kind and considerate and always willing to lend a helping hand without asking for anything in return. She is a people person and always takes their feeling into consideration before voicing an opionion. She never talks about anyone behind their back. She loves making people laugh. She loves children and the little ones can't stay away."

"my best friend NEVER lies to me, at the same time they phrase their response to something I might do, that they don't agree with in a way that's not hurtful. My best friend has always been there for me no matter what hour of the day or night. They know all about me, but like me anyway."
"A cowork of mine is one of my best friends.  We are close due to sharing an office for about a year, sharing space meant we had to understand each other. He keeps me on track for meeting my goals and keeping on track.  Having someone at work that you can depend on is important to my mental health.  It makes everyday better having someone I can depend on."
"This person is very honest and someone I truly care about.  She cares about me, too, and is always kind, going out of her way to do something nice for me.  She and I have a lot in common and never run out of things to talk about.  We also have lots of mutual friends, which makes our relationship even better."

"This guy is awesome.  He's really funny.  He's smart but still tough.  He's always good for a laugh."
"I really dislike my best friend. I feel that I can't even say a word around him because he is loud and crazy. He dosn't listen to how I am feeling. He makes me very insucure of myself. Every time I tell him something seceret he goes and tells the people that I didn't want him to tell. He's  a horrible friend."

"Kristi is such a great person.  She always has a smile on her face.  Her williness to go out of her way for others, is one of her finest qualities.  She is always there when you need her.  It is all about others, never about herself.  She is kind and considerate of people's feelings.  Kristi is such a caring friend."
"He's confident, and good for conversation -- there's never really a dull moment around him. He's pretty smart, too -- he has an intelligent, well-reasoned opinion on almost anything. He cares about his friends. He's well dressed and well-read, and one of the most cultured people I know. He's also constantly coming up with things to do -- I don't think he's capable of sitting around doing nothing for a day -- and he's quick to invite others to join in his fun."
"Emily is one of the most intelligent people I've ever known. In addition to being incredibly smart, she is also a giving and thoughtful person. She has a self-deprecating sense of humor that keeps everyone amused. She is a great listener and a truly supportive friend. She is someone I can always count on to be there for me. "
"My best friend is very loud and opinionated. She is kind of a drama queen, which makes her an interesting person to be around. Excitement and entertainment seem to follow her where ever she goes. We always have a lot of fun together, because she's so crazy I sometimes have a hard time believing what she says or does. I hate being bored, so she is the perfect best friend for me!"
"He is kind and dependable, someone that you know will be there to support you no matter what happens. He always puts everyone else's needs before his own and thinks of your feelings before speaking. He is kind, loving and does what he can for others. This person is very understanding and helpful in times of need. I am not sure what I would do without him in my life."
"This person has stabebd my in the back several times.  Although this person knows how much she has hurt me, she has never once apologized to me.  This person knows what a great person I am and how kind I am to everyone, yet she still sees a reason to disrepsect me.  She has not only lied to me, she has lied to several other people."
""Well i never really liked a classmate of mine. We used to have this atmosphere of tension between us and everyone knew about that. My motto is "" Be nice to people who are good with you and never bother about the rest who talk bad behind your back"" I can never stand someone spreading rumours about me or the other person. If u have any grudges against a person just let them know what harm did they ever do to you and just move on.Life is too short for all this. Better live it to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it""
"My friend, Glenn, is a constant source of fun.  We have great times together and can talk for hours.  We seem to understand each other very well.  He's a true friend to everyone he comes in contact with and would give the shirt off his back to anyone without expecting anything in return.  We share every little detail with each other without worrying about reproach.  We are free to be ourselves."
"Amanda is truly a fascinating person.  She is very intellegent and has so much potential in life.  Her wit is the thing I love most about her.  If you ever need a good laugh when you are feeling low, she is your girl.  She is also fervently loyal to what she believes in and her self confidence is a thing to be envied.   "
"My best friend is loud and always sticks up for herself. She is outgoing. I like that she fights for what she wants even when everyone else is against her. We talk about travel, pop culture and our jobs. She is always helpful when I need something."
