"The death penalty should stand as it is.  It is a necessary part of our criminal justice system. There are many criminals who would recidivate if given the chance and therefore cannot be put back into society.  However, for those who commit the most heinous of crimes, it is not feasible in terms of space or finances to keep them in prison for their entire lives.  Our prisons would be filled to the max in no time.  And it is the taxpayers who are having to pay to keep these most awful human beings alive and cared for."
"The death penalty is a disgrace. All life should be considered precious, no matter what sin the person has commited, he should always be given the oppurtunity to repent. Murdering to bring justice to a murderer is not a solution to the problem. These people need to be re-educated so they understand the error of their ways. If the can't obey the laws of society or feel the need to take a life they they are troubled individuals and they need help from doctors and psychiatrists."
""I do not believe in the death penalty. Taking someones life does not change the crime they committed. Only God has the right to take life and people are playing God when putting someone to death. Instead of killing offenders, we should focus on helping them and rehabilitating them. Especially the offenders who are mentally impaired; they might not have had control over the crime they committed.""
"Death penalty is a very cruel decision that is imposed. Any human being, who has been involved in a crime, may be given a chance to change the way of life. Some other punishment is acceptable instead of death penalty, as it brings a valuable human life to an end. It will not only impact the person on whom the death penalty has been imposed, but it will also affect that person\u2019s family to a greater extent. There are many ways to punish a person for the crime, but definitely not the death penalty."
"I don\u2019t feel the Death Penalty is right. People make mistakes in moments of passion. Our justice system is not perfect and innocent people are convicted. We could be killing innocent people. If a person certainly is guilty even of multiple deaths, the rest of their life in prison is a fitting punishment.  None of us have the right to take another life."
"The death penalty should be abolished, this is america, we dont do things like execute people in an inhumane manner. there is no crime worth punishing by death, we must always try to forgive. the federal govt needs to abolish all forms of capital punishment and control it. The death penalty is a cruel, archaic tradition and it does not lower crime."
"People who commit terrible crimes deserve to die.  Nobody needs them around anymore.  They do not deserve to live if they have maimed or killed another person. Their deaths serve the cause of justice. The families of the victims will feel better if the criminal is put to death."
"The death penalty should be illegal. Who's to say that the person is really guilty. Are we as humans able to play God? What's to stop after this? Should the government reglate human life? I think that there are other punishments better. Sometimes, I feel, that criminals want the death penalty. It's an easy way out."
"I dont believe in the death penalty. I dont think people should have to die for any reason. If you commit murder you should just have to spend the rest of your life in prison. I dont think you should have to die because you killed someone."
"Death penalty is very important as a deterrent against crime. We live in a society, not as individuals. This imposes some restrictions on our actions. If a person doesn't adhere to these restrictions, he or she forfeits her life. Why should taxpayers' money be spent on feeding murderers?"
"I think the death penalty is a bad idea. If we are responsible for murdering murderers, then how are we any better then they are? Plus there's always a chance that they are innocent, and then we would be even more corrupt for killing an innocent human being. If you ask me, the death penalty falls under the categorize of cruel and unusual punishment."
"I think people who do serious crimes deserve to die.  Corporal punishment does what it should and it causes fear in those who do wrong to not do wrong again.  Our incarceration system is overloaded with prisoners and the death penalty will help with the overcrowding.  Those who say that it is humane have never met with a serial killer or rapist, and do not understand."
"Some people don't deserve to live. They commit a horrific enough crime, why should we pay for their board in prison for life. Just get it over with and execute them. Only thing wrong with the death penalty is how long it takes."
"The death penalty is the worst thing anyone could impose.  Two wrongs do not make a right and a person should not die because they caused the death of another.  They should be punished, but with life in prison and not with death."
"The death penalty is wrong and sinful. It is wrong us to kill another person regardless of what they have done. It is not our place to judge whether another person lives or dies. The death penalty is institutionalized murder and should be abolished."
""The death penalty can often be an appropriate punishment for violent crimes.  The Bible teaches ""an eye for an eye"" and if someone harms or kills someone else, it is appropriate for them to be killed, as well.  Our system doesn't need violent criminals tying it up and the prisons don't need more murderers living in them.  Death can often be the best punishment for violent crimes, specifically murder.""
"I believe that the death penalty should never be used.  What if someone is convicted who is in face innocent?  There's been cases where DNA testing has cleared someone of a crime many years later.  I believe you should err on the side of caution and abolish the death penalty"
""In ancient times, there was the belief of ""an eye for an eye"".  As Ghandi once said, ""an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"".  We all are human and many people need to be reformed to learn from their mistakes.  Having the dealth penalty means that society refuses to give people a second chance to prove they can become better, and to that end, denies such people an opportunity to turn their lives around for the betterment of everyone.""
"The death penalty should not be enforced.  Everyone has a right to life.  No matter what the crime is, it is not correct to take another human being's life.  The person should have to sit for the rest of their life in a cell and think about the crime they committed.  They could also be used as an example to society as to why we have social norms against crimes committed by those that can possible receive the death penalty."
"I believe in the death penalty. I think it is the strongest form of punishment there could be. Also, there is a change a murderer could escape jail or kill others in jail. It is a form of protection also. "
"The death penalty is a good thing because the guilty deserve to die.  The death penalty discourages criminals from committing crimes.  Criminals can't be reformed so it's better to execute them.  Executing murderers helps the victim's family feel closure."
"I believe that every criminal can be rehabilitated. There is good side in everyone. Killing criminals would be dropping down to the levels of revenge. Making death penalty for a warning poster could not work, as criminaly in general aren't educated."
"Why should someone who has killed not die? They have taken a life and deserve for their life to be taken. They do not deserve to live in this world even as a prisoner. Also, sitting on death row will give them time to think about their actions. They will possibly be in fear everyday. Thinking that the next day could be the day that they die."
"The death penalty is a horrible and outdated system of criminal justice. People have the right to be alive and a system that takes a life is no better than a murderer. New techniques for rehabilitation are constantly being tried. The death penalty is a weak minded method of dealing with a criminal mind that is not understood."
"We should abolish the death penalty, not because it is cruel or unjust to those being executed, but rather because it demeans the lives of the rest of us. When as a society, we are taking the life of anyone, we are essentially saying that we have given up, that life itself is just not that important. That is a grave and painful message to send to all those members of a society. It also gives a heavy-handed, if unstated, message: you just don't mean that much. "
"I think that the death penalty is wrong. God told us not to kill so this is a direct dishonor to his commandments. Everyone deserves a second chance so who are we to judge? The death penalty is just another way to thin down the population. Two wrongs don't make a right and it won't change what they did."
"The death penalty is cruel and inhumane.  All of our fellow man deserve the chance to reform and change their lives.  At the heart of every person is good, and through counselling and therapy that good can come through.  It is not the right of one judge or jury to end the life of another person, no matter what crime that person committed."
"Only the death penalty will deter criminals, so that is why we have to have it.  It is expensive keeping serious criminals in prison for the remainder of their lives.  There is always a chance that a Ted Bundy-type criminal will escape prison, which puts a serial killer back on the streets.  There are people who cannot be rehabilitated."
"We actually save money by sentencing to death penalty. Family of the victim will get vengeance. One less criminal in the world does help. We should always have death penalty because it is an easy way to get rid of criminals."
"And Eye for an Eye is what the Bible says.  If someone is a threat to society, they should be killed.  We should clear the earth of all wrong doing by killing the ones that have committed rape and murder.  The evidence gathered this day in age is substantial enough to put someone to death.  If the guilty party does not want to live by the rules imposed by society, then they have no right to live."
"I believe there is no instance when the death penalty is the right choice.  We as humans do not have the right to take the life of another.  No matter what the crime, we can not play God and take someone's life.  There is a higher source to ultimately answer to."
"As a civilized society we cannot condone the very actions we seek to punish via our justice system.  The government's role should not involve decisions that involve taking human life.  The option to jail a perpetrator for life still exists for the extremely dangerous and so it is false to argue that death is the only option in some cases.  In addition there is a chance that the court decides wrongly and someone is wrongly executed and this is simply unacceptable."
"I dont believe the death penalty is morally correct. These people may have committed terrible crimes but they dont deserve to die. Innocent people could end up being put to death and that is worse than any crime. If just put in prison these people could have a chance to be rehabilitated."
"The death penalty is a justified means of punishment for anyone who chooses to kill. If we just put murderers in prison, the taxpayers hold the burden of keeping them alive. This is unacceptable. Innocent taxpayers should not be forced to provide for criminals. By employing the death penalty, murderers get just what they deserve. If you kill, if you take another's life, if you put someone's family through such distress-you deserve the same. "
"Just the mere fact that the death penalty causes moral arguments and debates should be enough evidence that it is wrong.  If the answer to the problem is not clear, it is always better to take the high moral road.  There is no harm in not killing someone. The punishment of life in prison is every bit as harsh as death, while not being morally reprehensible.  Not to mention the fact that every year you hear stories of innocent men being released from jail.  As horrible as putting a man in jail for a crime he did not commit can be, there is no bringing back a man from his death.  "
"As a society we can't afford to spend millions of dollars keeping criminals alive who have committed horrible crimes. We can't afford to worry about the slim possibility that the criminals are innocent. We can hope to offer the victims closure and a chance to move on."
"I believe there should be no death penalty, regardless of the nature of the crime. Instating the death penalty is playing God. It is not for us to judge the unjust murderers. God will judge them and they will be forgiven or condemned to damnation."
"I believe that the death penalty is wrong because human beings are so complex.  We don't really know the full psyche of another human being.  We can't completely understand where they're coming from.  If there is a possibility of a gene being linked to crimes without conscience, surely we must take into account that we can't know everything yet.  Surely we all have the capability within ourselves to change."
""In any modern society, there must be protection for the masses.  The only way to deter crime is to reinforce the notion that there are consequences for criminal behavior; the more serious the crime, the more serious the punishment.  And as logical and reasonable members of society, we must have the ability to apply the most serious punishment (the death penalty) to those crimes judged as being the most reprehensible.""
"I approve of the death penalty in all aspects. People that commit these crimes do not have a reason to live and should be put to death. Whether it be lethal injection or electrocution, these criminals deserve a sentence no less than what the judge gave them. Would you want someone who murdered someone you love able to ever walk the streets again? Neither would I."
"The death penalty should never be used in any circumstance. It is unjust and cruel. Even the most perverse and unrepentant convict should only be expected to serve life in prison. These people should be safeguarded from the general prison population and cared for until the end of their days."
"The death penalty is a good method of punishment for violent criminals. While some criminals can be rehabilitated, others cannot. Death Row prisoners are those who cannot be rehabilitated. The only way to be sure that they will not commit more crimes is to be rid of them entirely. The death penalty acts as a good deterrent for people who might otherwise commit violent crimes. The death penalty is also more humane than it used to be."
"If you commit murder you should pay the price with your life. Those individual deserve the ultimate punishment. The death penalty can help deter crime. It will make society much better with them off the street."
"The death penalty is the ultimate revenge. The families of the victims or the victims themselves can feel a sense of closure and retribution. The death penalty eliminates the possiblity of escapes and repeat offenders because it eliminates the offenders. The inmates must face their death head on. They are usually put into solitary confinement at least 60 days before execution and not only that but most are not executed for 10-20 years. That is a lot of time to think about the wrongs they have done."
"I feel that the death penalty is highly effective and should continue to be part of our legal system.  Primarily the death penalty works as a deterrent to keep individuals from performing heinous acts against fellow citizens.  Without the death penalty more people would feel free to break the law since there is no real punishment other than an all expenses paid residency at a prison, and they don\u2019t even have to work.  Speaking of which, the care and feeding of existing criminals is a drain on our tax dollars, and I feel that we should extend the death penalty to other crimes to lighten the burden on our prison system."
"Life is a valuable thing. It is not right to take someone's life. Judges and people in a courtroom are not the ones to judge the value of a person's life, the only being allowed to judge the valuability of a person's life is God. Therefore, the death penalty should not be used because who are we to put a value on someone's life."
"Death penalty serves right for those who think they are bigger than the law and can get away with murder. If someone decides to prematurely end someone else's life then theirs should be prematurely ended. That will make them think before they act and at least remaining relatives of the victims do not have to put up with knowing some murder might one day come back."
"I support the death penalty.  I believe the threat of the death penalty as a consequence of criminal behavior does have value as a deterrent.  At the same time, I recognize that there will be certain criminals out in the world for whom the death penalty will never be a deterrent.  But I believe for the majority of people out there, criminals included, the threat of death as a consequence of a person's actions could be enough to keep that person from comitting a crime."
"The death penalty is a barbaric practice and should be abolished. Innocent people have been murdered after being falsely imprisoned. If any one innocent person has died because of an error in  the legal system then that is one too many. The death penalty does not save money since many prisoners sit on death rows for many years before the sentence is carried out. Statistics show that the death penalty is not a deterrent of crime in the states where it is impelemted. The american legal system is about rehabilitation, and teh death penalty does not leave that option for everyone."
"A fundamental mark of civilised society is the value it gives to the life of an individual. Who are we, society, to determine that a man lose his life, even for the most heinous of crimes. It is for God to judge, not man. Even without the debate about whether we can eliminate every trace of doubt about a man's guilt or innocence, we must stand firm against the death penalty as a matter of principle. No man should be permitted to take the life of another."
"The death penalty is an abomination, the absolute lowest man could possibly achieve.  Every human being is guilty of sinning at one point or another, but there is no sin so great that can not be forgiven.  A murderer may not be a role model, but for no reason deserves to be murdered himself.  The death penalty should be abolished.  The solution is to seek help from those of us with a clear conscience, and a clear connection with God."
"I do not think it is right to kill someone in the name of justice.  How can you say to kill anyone is proper justice?  If a jury decides someone is guilty, then they should serve their time in prison where they belong.  Prison is a hard enough place as it is, you have taken somenoes life away and made them sit in a cell with nothing.  To take their life is to decide you are their judge and ultimately you are not.  Two wrongs dont make a rigt."
"People who commit crimes that are so heinous as to defy common decency should not have the right to live.  Moreover, there is no reason why taxpayer dollars should support them to live a life of relative luxury.  The only way to truly punish evil people and to prevent future heinous crimes, is to require a painful execution of the guilty.  This way, anyone who wants to commit a capital crime will think twice, lest they want to go through horrible punishments.  Lastly, killing someone is the only way to ensure they can't escape from prison or that some liberal do gooder will release them from prison even if they have a life sentence."
"People should always be given a second chance. People are inherently good, and if they are put to death right away, they will not be able to demonstrate this. Someone may have been wrongfully convicted of a crime that warrants the death penalty. A person that has been wrongfully convicted should not be put to death. It would be horrible if someone were sentenced to death, killed, and then later proven innocent."
"The death penalty protects innocent citizens from murderers, rapists, and other violent and malicious criminals. Without the death penalty, prisons would also be over crowded, and the non-violent criminals would have to live in cells with the violent criminals and violent sexual offenders. I think the death penalty is a just punishment because when someone commits murder they are automatically forfeiting their right to life. Without the death penalty, there would definitely be an increase in violent crime rapes and murders."
"The death penalty, so long as it is instituted in only the most egregious of cases, is appropriate and, in fact, necessary to preserve our safety.  Without the death penalty, an criminal spending life in prison has no deterrence from commiting further violent acts, since the sentence cannot really be extended.  For instance, for the truly ruthless miscreant, it would be in his/her best interest to kill as many people as necessary to facilitate escape from prison.  Also, from a religious standpoint, eye for an eye is absolutely justifiable.  And in most cases, the decision is strongly influenced by the loved ones of the victim, and they are the ones who deserve justice."
""The death penalty at its core is undoubtedly unconstitutional. Punishments for crimes, no matter the severity, have to abide by the criteria of not being ""cruel and usual."" Taking the life of an individual is a the same offense that one would be prosecuted for. Therefore, if it is considered ""cruel"" to murder a person, it should also be considered ""cruel"" to subject them to capital punishment. There are significant methods of punishments that do not include the death of any person. ""
"The death penalty is not the answer. All the death penalty does is bring more pain and more suffering to an already painful situation. I believe carrying out the death penalty only brings humanity down. Death, violence, and crime should not be answered with more death- it only creates an endless cycle. There is also the dangerous chance that the justice system executes an innocent man. Although  it's not good to falsely imprison an innocent man, at least that person would be alive. Plus, it seems senseless to execute someone if there is a small chance that they could be recuperated and later have something to add to society."
"I believe in the death penalty. Why should victims have to live with the fact their loved ones are dead and the murderer is alive? Why should a person be allowed to remain alive if they are simply a burden to society? Why should society waste food on a murderer when there are starving children in the world? If there are not serious consequences to taking a life, such as the death penalty, what is to deter future murderers from committing murders?"
"There is no telling how many innocent people have died on death row.  Since our justice system is not fool proof, and is contaminated with corruption at all different levels and angles, a fair and just trial can almost never be obtained.  When the people are looking for someone to hang, any evidence can look shady.  If you take the life of a person who has taken someone elses life, doesn't that make you just as guilty, if not more.  "
"An \u201ceye for an eye\u201d is a legitimate philosophy to use in punishing violent criminals. Why shouldn\u2019t a murdered meet the same fate of their victim? The death penalty provides a very appropriate punishment for serious crimes and is a deterrent to committing those crimes. The death penalty also provides a way to permanently rid society of violent offenders once and for all."
"If we sit down and think about it, God should have the only right to take some one from this earth.  Not another man/women.  When we decide to give someone a death sentence it can cause a lot of issues.  While yes the victims survivors and the district attorneys may see the death penalty as a viable choice, it is not there true decision.  And that decision is left for god, while we may not forgive he can forgive all.  So in my belief is that no man should be able to take another ones in revenge.  And may god have mercy on your soul if you do."
"How can we as a people ever say it's okay kill another human being? We do not have the right to take the lives of others and by doing so we are commiting the most aggregious of sins. Simply put it's murder. And to pass judgement on a person and kill them for whatever act they carried out, does not then make their act go away. It does not influence crime in any way, people who murder do not take the death penalty into consideration before doing so, they just murder. What happens if we execute even one single innocent person? We already know that this has happened, so it worth keeping a law on the books that we know has led to the deaths of innocent people? I think not."
"The death penalty should be done away with completely. If we kill anyone it is considered murder, so we would be just as guilty as those we are punishing. The death penalty is very cruel and inhumane, some prisoners suffer unduly and unjustly before they die. We don't torture animals, we should have the same respect for humans. "
""I do not believe in the death penalty because I don't see what good it does.  It does not deter crime, people still kill and mutilate each other even though the death penalty exists.  When we take another life we are reducing ourselves to the level of the criminal and not showing justice and mercy.  There is no way to rehabilitate a person who is dead!  The death penalty does nothing for the criminal justice system; it does not reduce crime and it does not make us safe so I can't see what possible good can come from killing another human being.""
"The death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.  Many people who have been killed, or while on death row, were later absolved of their crime due to new evidence being presented during appeal.  Death row is a section of the prison used for continuous solitary confinement and is a poor use of space in such an overcrowded system.  Criminals committing a crime punishable by death are not going to fear the sentence at the time of the felony act and are therefore not a deterrent in behavior."
"Death penalty is an extreme punishment. It shows that barbasism is being used to deal with barbarism. There should be no death penalty as it is unjustified to take anyone's life, no matter what the reason. A person who makes a mistake shoud be given a chance to turn over a new leaf, and the reasons for his taking that path must be understood sympathetically. Mercy is an important trait and one must show mercy. "
""As the Old Testament recommends, ""an eye for an eye,"" must be vigorously observed and applied.  If you kill me or another, then you should be killed, whatever the circumstances.  There are no mitigating circumstances. Your erasure will clear the world of evil. We will be greatly improved by your death, feeling better that we have killed you.""
"The death penalty itself is a moral imperative. Criminals found guilty of crimes warranting it's use are not able to be rehabilitated through the penal system. Keeping these criminals alive is a fiscal burden to the state and the tax payers. What justice to we bring to the families of those wronged by the crimes of the guilty? What does life in prison accomplish? Who does it serve? Certainly not the people. Certainly not the cause of justice."
"In this case the death penalty is the accurate punishment.If someone kills someone , he or she has no right to live in the world because who kills someone ,not only kills a person but also kills a whole family virtually.he or she destroys the lives of every one who is directly related to him or her.Death penalty gives the relief  to the family of the person who is killed.It also make the eco balance of the world to stay in peace."
""It's very nice and cool to say life is your first undeniable right, but reality is, some things you do (by your free choice!) make you just unworthy of living. Life is not a value per se: you live in a society, which has rules to respect. If your fault is so hard it can't be mended in any way, then death penalty is the only solution. Cold blood killers can't be thought able to repent and change; when you go that far, you just lose all your humanity and that's the moment when you deserve death.""
"The death penalty is wrong as individuals are falsely accused by the legal system and unfairly put to death for crimes they did not commit. The death penalty is against basic human laws of taking life from an individual. The death penalty costs more than housing an individual with a life sentence. Society becomes more immune to violent crime when the death penalty is an option. This immunity to violent crime leads to an increase in the number of violent crimes committed."
"The death penalty has been around in one form or another since the beginning of time.  The current use of the death penalty is actually the most advanced and humane system in history.  In the USA at least, people are put to death when they have committed severe crimes and when they can not be rehabilitated.  Since these criminals are such a danger to society, there is no reason to keep them incarcerated for life, they are simply a drain on the system, not to mention a danger if they should ever manage to escape.  Some people say that the death penalty is wrong, but every person in our country knows that if they are a criminal and are caught, they will be punished.  If a person doesn't want to risk the death penalty, they shouldn't commit a crime in the first place.  "
"I feel that the death penalty is an integral piece of our legal system and is necessary to maintain order and safety in our country. Violent and dangerous criminals must be shown that their behavior will not be tolerated in civilized society. Violent rapists and sadistic murderers are never going to be reformed. These people are a danger to society and need to be kept off of the streets permanently. If we keep them in prison for the majority of their lifetimes, we are simply forcing the public to take financial responsibility for these criminals, who, through their crimes, have already been a burden on society. Their behavior warrants death and they are only getting what they have earned. "
"The death penalty should be employed for all cases for which its use was developed.  No one who has comitted a crime serious enough to deserve the death penalty should be pardoned, end of story.  The human race is entering an age of advanced weapons and disguise, and it is not safe to let every wood-be assassin run around comitting crimes of such aserious nature.  These people should be stopped at the first offense and sentenced to death.  this is the only way to insure the safety of society and the human race as a whole.  If those who should have recieved the death penalty are left to wander freely, the authorities will be putting the lives of countless innocents at risk.  This rule should apply to all offfenders, including those who comitted a crime unintentionally and without knowledge of what they have done.  A killer is a killer whether he kills out of hate or mistake.  "
"I believe that the death penalty should be aborted from our legal system. I believe the death penalty is a cruel and unusual form of punishment, which is in direct violation of our Eighth Amendment right granted to us by the U.S. Constitution. In addition to this, I believe that the death penalty is not an effective 'bargaining chip' for American District Attorneys. When DA's and suspects work out a plea agreement, suspects' lawyers usually keep their clients quiet and try to work out the plea in some other way. I believe that life in prison is a much more suitable punishment for serious crimes, and from what I understand, LESS costly than a death sentence, since most criminals on death row appeal their sentences for years, costing our court systems more money. "
"I don't know how anyone could take it upon themselves to take another human life by using the death penalty. It isn't right to take a life, period. Just because this person done something wrong doesn't give society the right to be like a GOD of some kind and take life. How would you feel if you were on a jury and gave the person the death penalty and it later came out that the person was innocent? The death penalty only puts the person(s) and the state(s) who choose this form of punishment down to a level lower than the person who committed the crime in the first place. Under no circumstances should the government be able to take a humans life."
"It costs tax payers more for someone to face the death penalty than serving for life in jail. We aren't God to take someone's life. We are just as bad and cruel as the criminals if we believe in death. We are saying that killing is the right thing to do. It doesn't bring the victim back."
"A person murders or causes grave damage to another human being without thought, remorse or reason. It could be your child, your mother, your neighbor or some unknown fellow human being. With overcrowding of prisons, there is a real chance this murderer could be released within ten years to enact the same crime to another innocent bystander. Prisons do not reform. They are a breeding ground for more violent behavior inside of the walls. When a jury or a judge has reviewed a criminal's behavior and conviction and has sentenced the offender to death, this animal needs to be put out of misery while protecting other citizens from his wrath.  He or she obviously did not think twice about taking another person's life. The judicial system as already considered his life more important by considering all aspects before they sentenced him to death. The death penalty is there for a reason: to get these hardened, unremorseful killers out of circulation."
"I think it goes againt God to put someone to death. Life in prison is time for the criminal to repent and seek forgivness. I think its inhumane to kill another human being."
"Death penalty should be banned in any society.By ordering the death penalty to a person who killed another, are we also not committing the same crime!.We are not allowing the criminal to repent or change himself by ordering the death punishment.He could possibly help in serving the world a better place to live."
"The death penalty should be used as a deterrent to serious crimes. Taxpayers should not have to support inmates for years before the execution in death penalty cases.  There are too many appeals and delays before sentence is carried out.  The executions should be taking place as soon as possible after sentencing to relieve overcrowded jails and lessen the government's expense to keep prisoners."
"Death penalties are by no means the carriers of fury, hatred, vengeance, a vindication of the law abider, or just 'an eye for an eye' act.  They should not at any rate be done away with, as they are the only sure fire deterrents to willful perpetrators of inhuman acts.  The criminals should be brought to book and without any second thought, should be mercilessly dealt with impunity.  This should lessen the number of serious crimes, if not put an end to them, in the society.  The world will undoubtedly be a better place to live in, if done so.  Try to cleanse the world of evil doers so that the good samaritans live happily and long enough."
""I support the death penalty as the ultimate punishment for violent crimes.  When a criminal knows that they can die as a result of his or hers actions, it stops them from going forward with a premeditated violent act.  Societies that support the death penalty are safer and have less crime.  The legal system in the US is the best in the world.  The number of people sentenced wrongly is so small that it is not even statistically significant.  As a Christian, my god is a ""vengeful god.""  There are many examples in the Bible in which God punished wrong doers.  Furthermore, family members who are able to witness the death of the assailant who harmed their loved one are more able to put to rest their anguish.""
"The death penalty is a necessary evil if we are to deal with the worst elements of society. Some people are just too dangerous to be allowed to live among us, and even life imprisonment allows the possibility of parole and eventual release. Some crimes are so heinous and so shocking that the death penalty is the only true reflection of the outrage of the community, and the only punishment that fits the crime. There is no doubt that the government's right to sentence the worst criminals to death has a powerful deterrent effect, and protects the majority of law abiding citizens from harm. To commit a cruel murder or a brutal rape is an act of free will, and anyone who perpetrates such a crime must accept the potential consequences of their actions. When all is said and done the death penalty saves lives."
"The death penalty should be outlawed because it is a cruel and unusual punishment. Under the constitution all citizens are protected from such a penalty. Further more it is never certain that the person being executed is truly the person that committed the crime. When DNA testing came along many inmates were proven innocent, who knows how many innocent people were executed before that. Eliminating the death penalty would give wrongly convicted citizens more of a chance to be proven innocent and those who are guilty a chance to gain redemption for their actions. By executing a murderer we as a society are sinking to their level and become no better than they are. We should strive to improve our society as a whole instead of focusing on delivering death to those who need help the most. "
"If a person commits a horrible crime, it is only right that the people affected by it get justice. Sitting in jail is too good for violent criminals as jails have been made too comfortable and the criminals can get out much too easily. The death penalty prevents the criminal from committing more crimes. It also deters other people from commit a violent crime as they know they can get a death sentence for it."
"I believe that some people deserve the death penalty and nothing less if justice is to be served.  Anyone who takes the life of another should experience at least some of the fear that their victims felt.  How would you feel if someone murdered your mother or your child?  Wouldn't you want them to pay?  With so called life in prison they will still experience things they like such as TV, music, food.  Your dead loved one will never enjoy anything again.  What if the murderer gets paroled?  Then they'll be out there doing as they please and possibly kill again.  If it's possible for these monsters to get away with murder even if they get caught they have little to stop them.  If they might die because of their actions then maybe they'll think twice. "
""The death penalty is an important American tradition and a useful tool to punish people who are guilty of committing heinous crimes.  It serves as a warning to others who are considering committing the same crimes.  The Bible says ""an eye for an eye"" and it is only natural that the friends and families of crime victims should want to seek revenge against the perpetrators of those crimes.  It often eases their pain and gives them the feeling justice has been served.  No legal system is perfect and mistakes will be made on the rare occasion but it is worth the risk - it is better that one innocent person is executed than that many vicious killers are let off the hook.  The rest of the world should stay out of the United States' business and stop condemning us for exercising our right punish our citizens as we see fit. ""
"I oppose the death penalty and cannot believe that such a barbaric practice can still be allowed in our modern society.  Killing another human being is murder, and even if the act is justified it lowers us all to the level of mere thieves and murderers.  Regardless of one's own moral outlook on the death penalty, it is also the wiser economical choice to oppose it.  It costs more to put someone to death in America than it does to keep them alive and on death row for the rest of their life.  With the current economic crisis it seems as if we should all be looking for ways to save money, and the abolition of the death penalty is a wise move for both economic and moral reasons."
"I believe that the death penatly is unjust. Why should we take the lives of human kind? Yes, people do things that are wrong, but do we want to be just as wrong as them to kill them? What about mentally challanged people, we should just kill them and they will die not even knowing what they truly did wrong? How is that fair? I believe that if someone does commit a crime they should be held responsibel for it. We don't need to be the ones who kill them. How does that do any justice? Let them die in prison, what good is it for us to kill them before their time? I believe that it makes us just as wrong as them."
"Taking a life by the death penalty will not reverse the crime.  Give this criminal a chance to change and be a productive citizen.  It is our responsibility to look past the crime and see the person.  Murder is wrong, Vengeance Is Mine, saith the Lord.  Who has appointed us to order death?  That is a demand to heavy to be placed upon another human.  Life is something only God can take, He doesn't need help from man."
""Killing people is good when you do it in the name of justice and vengeance!  The bible says ""an eye for an eye"" and mentions something about being my brothers keeper, does it not?  Spare the rod and spoil the children?  How about, ""Vengeance is MINE! sayeth the Lord""?  All of these great quotes of scripture from the 6th and the 12th century which rang as true then as they do today.  Don't take my word for it;  Take God's!  That whole ""Thou shall not kill"" business was meant to apply to the serfs and plebes of the world, not to governing powers and ruling elite (who have enjoyed torturing, killing, and dismembering their subjects both then and now) because EVERYBODY knows that God is a Democrat!  So when you kill a person (or even if we expect that you might have) you can be sure that we are going to take you down a peg (from alive to something less) unless your name is king, general, sultan, or president.  We will kill who we feel needs killing, and if you don't like it then you can just take it up with the Big Guy when were done dealing with you, too!""
"The death penalty is an entirely necessary and sensible solution to dealing with vicious criminals and cold hearted felons who are unfit to live in society. There is no reason to allow someone who is a danger to other people to be allowed to live a normal lifespan nor give them any mercy. Jails have become lenient and life in prison sometimes turns out to be merely a sentence of a few years which is an insult to victims and families of victims. We all are in control of our actions and when someone chooses the wrong path and is sentenced to death in a fair trial, the execution should be carried out with no fanfare or sentiment. The death penalty is an economical and logical solution that does not need to be defended when one applies the laws of common sense and fair play. We need to keep the death penalty as it deters people from committing heinous crimes and it removes the possibility that that person would ever be able to commit another crime again."
"The death penalty saves Americans millions in taxes for keeping inmates in jail.  Some criminals cannot be rehabilitated in jail and are a lost cause.  Keeping them in jail only wastes money.  Inmates who have life sentences' lives are already over so it is just smarter to make it easier on them."
"The death penalty is the only answer for horrible crimes such as murder.  A life for a life.  Anyone that hurts someone so badly deserves to die.  When they committed the murder they took away all their rights to live.  People who committ these kinds of crimes are not good people anyway."
"I go for Death Penalty for the reason that it will control the crimes that is happening around us. If Death Penalty is imposed then a lot of this crime problems will decrease due to the fact that those people will be afraid to commit such crime knowing that they will pay it with their lives when they get caught."
"An eye for an eye, a life for a life is an idea rooted deep in our history.  Societies right and duty to extract the ultimate penalty from those who comment that most heinous of crimes is absolute.  Unless potential criminals know that by their actions they could be forfeiting their right to life, they will not hesitate to take lives.  And once they have been removed from society, we as a people need no longer fear that they will murder again."
