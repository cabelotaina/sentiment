"I believe the death penalty should be abolished.  As a country that was founded on Christian principles, this in one area of the law that has strayed far off the path.  God should be the only giver of life and death.  To end someone's life for any reason is sinful.  It is just and right to punish those who commit crimes and keep them segregated from society for the safety of others.  Those people will have their true punishment on the day of judgment."
"I believe the death penalty is a necessity in modern society. Prisons are becoming overcrowded, and many of the worst felons are incarcerated for life. Our country is wasting valuable money and resources maintaining despicable twisted criminals who will never be reintroduced to society. The threat that if you you take a life, your life can be taken for that debt is an important measure to keep society in check."
"I fully support the death penalty for violent criminals. I believe murderers, rapists, child abusers, and very violent criminals should be put to death. These people who can commit such crimes as those cannot be rehabilitated. Something is fundamentally wrong with their thinking and reasoning. They should not have the privilege of living and we should not have to support them as tax payers."
"Death penalty is a must any country because that creates some fear in every human being not to do anything that may lead to death penalty. It is strongly believed only those crime mistakes that a person indulge will only be lead to death penalty. Unless, this death penalty is not imposed for a crime which affects the society, the crime will continue without an end to it. Death penalty, not only creates the fear but also it helps the country and the society to reduce the crime rate. Overall, the death penalty brings the crime awareness to everyone and prohibits from indulging in such acts."
"I believe in the Death Penalty. I think when a person commits a crime deemed utterly heinous and unpardonable by the people, they should be executed. They forfeit their life for the one(s)  taken.  What else are we to do with a person that would be so uncaring as to kill another? The life or lives taken can never be regained, they should pay for their deeds. I have no pity for them or how they can change while in prison."
"My opinion is the death penalty should be used in cases of mass murder, murdering a child/ law enforcement officer/ in commision of a crime, cases of terrorism. It should be only used in the most extreme cases. The exexcution should be carried out by lethal injection only. It should be up to the states and not the federal govt if there is a death penalty in a particular state."
"The death penalty has been used for centuries but people are still criminals.  The death penalty does not work as a deterrent.  It does not teach the criminal anything because the dead cannot learn from their mistakes or make restitution.  People should have to stay in prison and make amends instead of dying."
""I am a firm believer in the saying ""An eye for an eye"". If you choose to commit a crime, you should be punished. If you kill someone, you shouldn't be allowed to continue living. I am a strong supporter of the death penalty.""
"I believe in the death penalty for people who have committed murder or other brutal crimes. I believe that if you commit a crime you should be punished accourdingly. Therefore if you commit murder you should be put to death. If you brutaly assault someone to death you should be put to death and so on."
"I stand against death penalty. It is pompous of anyone to think that they have the right to take life. No court of law can eliminate all possibilities of doubt. Also, some circumstances may have pushed a person to commit a crime that would otherwise merit severe punishment."
"I think the death penalty is in some cases necessary. If someone is a proven serial killer, then they should definitely get the death penalty. I don't want to take any chances of them getting out of jail, and killing again. Plus if we just give them a life sentence we're essentially paying for their food, medication, and whatever else they get while in jail. Why should our tax dollars go toward harboring a serial killer? "
"Corporal punishment does not work.  Why?  Because all it does is cause fear in the person, whereas reform is needed.  Furthermore, we do not live in an eye for an eye society like those long ago.  We need to reform our incarceration system because it does not work as well as we would like to think."
"I think it is wrong for one person to take the life of another.The state does not have the right to take life any more than the criminal. Also, we turn our society into people prepared to clamour for death when someone has committed a crime. 'Christians' demanding death instead of forgiveness. "
"I believe that the death penalty should be in place.  If a person is willing to take the life of another, then they should be willing to pay with their own life.  I believe in the 10 commandments and though many do not agree with me, it is my feeling that killing someone is wrong and you should pay with your life. The bible says an eye for an eye. "
"The death penalty is sometimes the most realistic and proper means of dealing with a criminal. In many cases, criminal actions are the result of mental conditions or predispositions which can not be reversed or cured. In addition, the death penalty is preferable in cases where an individual has the potential to continue to do harm even once behind bars. While the death penalty is certainly not appropriate in all situations, there are many cases in which it is the best option."
"The death penalty is wrong for many reasons, such as the fact that it costs tax payers more money due to appeals and that it's killing someone to punish for a violent crime.  It's irrational and contradictory to think that killing someone because they killed someone else is a just punishment and shows how confused our justice system is.  Research also shows that due to appeals, it is more costly to give someone the death penalty than life in prison.  Though rare, it's also possible that the person who committed the crime is innocent and has been wrongly killed."
"I believe that in cases of murder the death penalty should be enforced.  If you take someone's life, you have no right to continue to draw breath.  Without the threat of death as a punishment, it's hard to deter someone from committing murder."
"I believe that all people are human and make mistakes.  However, in some instances, people who have commit horrid crimes against innocent parties, and have no viable chance at reforming themselves, are a threat to society.  For this reason it is critical that we retain use of the death penalty.  It must be used solely as a last resort and not to be taken lightly, but proves necessary to protect our society's wellbeing."
"I believe the death penalty should be enforced.  Those who have been sentenced to the death penalty do not deserve life.  Most often, the death penalty is sentenced to a person that has committed the worst of crimes, usually involving the taking of another person's life.  This person that committed this terrible crime should not be taking up space in a prison for life.  Rather than waste taxpayer's money on this person they can remain in a cell for the rest of their life until they die, the death penalty would eliminate this costly burden on society."
"I do not believe in the death penalty. I feel that years in jail is the proper punishment. We cannot murder someone simply because they have commited a crime, even if equal to murder. I believe in a lifetime in jail and punishment."
"I believe the death penalty is immoral because there is always a chance that an innocent person could be executed.  I am against capital punishment because all life is precious.  Executions just feed mob mentality and satisfy revenge.  The death penalty doesn't give criminals a chance to change and reform."
"I believe that there are some criminals which could not be rehabilitated. Keeping them in the jails for all of their life, costs money. Also, some crimes are so dreadful and people who have made them don't deserve to live. Also, death penalty for some sorts of crime will serve as a warning sign for others."
"Everyone deserves the right to live. I don't believe anyone should be put to death for a crime they committed. Most deaths are done quickly by simple lethal injection. The criminal does not even feel anything. I think they will suffer a lot more in prison."
"I think the death penalty has merit in society. The average person needs to understand that there are some crimes that are so horrific that there is no forgiveness. Also, some people are so far outside society's standard that there is no rehablitation that could make the person useful. The death penalty is the appropriate method of taking useless members of society out of taxpayers hands and freeing society of a burden."
"The death penalty is an absolute necessity for at least two reasons. First, incarceration will not prevent those who order the killings of others from continuing to do so. Organized crime bosses are just as capable of ordering deaths from prison as they are anywhere else. Second, there are those murderers who are a threat to others even after they have been imprisoned. I don't think we should put government employees in close contact with violent killers who have nothing to lose. "
"I believe that the death penalty should be preserved to only the most heinous crimes. I don't think that we should let murders and rapists live comfortably on the tax payers money while they live their lives. Being locked up is not enough for people who take another's life. After all, if someone killed and raped a child, would you want to pay for their meals and care until they died?"
"I believe the punishment should fit the crime, in that sense sometimes the death penalty is appropriate.  If a convicted criminal clearly has no chance of reform or no benefit to society then the taxpayers shouldn't have to be burdened to house this person for the rest of his or her life.  Humane methods of course should be used.  Multiple murders, serial killers, global terrorists, these are people that deserve the death penalty."
"I believe the death penalty is unethical.  First, it is unfair, since minorities and people in poverty are disproportionately on death row.  Secondly, human forms of justice are necessarily imperfect, so having the death penalty means that innocent people will be killed.  We have seen examples of this as DNA evidence cleared some people who had been in prison for decades.  "
"We should not play as god to choose if someone should live or die. It is the easiest way for this criminal to end his pain. Death penalty is not civilized. We are helping them by ending their misery faster. Criminals should pay their crime for the rest of their life and live with the pain that the gave."
""I feel as if the death penalty is murder in itself. I do not believe that any man should be able to decide the fate of another man regardless of his wrong doings.  There are many cases in which an innocent person has been put to death due to stereotypes of the perpatraitor and lack of DNA evidence many years ago.  I think the people passing judgement onto the ""guilty"" parties are sadistic and murderers themselves.  No one has the right to sentence someone else to death. It reminds me of the witch hunts in early America.  People impose these verdicts out of fear, out of power, and for political gain.""
"Choosing the death penalty is a difficult decision for most of us.  I believe it is the most extreme of acceptable punishments within our Justice System, and should be allowed in all 50 U.S. States when the actions warrant it.  Being convicted of multiple pre-meditated murders, heinous crimes with extenuating circumstances - these are the things I believe a person should be given the death penalty for."
"The death penalty is an essential component of a comprehensive justice system.  There are cases where an individual's behavior is so repulsive and the potential harm that they can do to society is so great that this is the only suitable punishment.  Among repeat offenders of incredibly violent crime the recidivism rates are incredibly high and the cost of maintaining the offender jailed for life is far too high for society.  In cases where repeat violence has been shown multiple times and in each case has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt this is the outcome that best protects society and minimizes societies burden at the hands of these criminals.  To keep them jailed for life or to release them back to society often results in great harm being done to additional innocent and law abiding citizens."
"I think the death penalty is good. People who commit terrible crimes deserve to die. Living is a right and if you abuse that right to an extreme then you do deserve to die. Only serious offenders should be punished this way and each case needs to be looked at objectively. The death penalty also helps create space in our overcrowded prisons."
""It is my opinion that the death penalty should be abolished. It is an unreasonable, cruel punishment. I've heard the argument, ""an eye for an eye"", time and time again, but this is the most hypocritical justification for using the death penalty. If we kill every criminal who has killed, we are no better than he is. Instead we are condoning murder. The death penalty is murder, plain and simple. We have no right to take any human life nor do we have the right to judge another based on his actions. Final judgment should be left up to God. ""
"The death penalty can be a hard moral concept to accept.  However, when someone has clearly broken the law in the worst possible way, it is necessary to punish that person accordingly.  Picture your sister or daughter or even your own mother getting raped and then beaten to death.  The monster that performed those acts deserves to be punished and that is why I believe in the need for a death penalty."
"The death penalty is not an appropriate punishment for heinous crimes. I cannot emphasize enough that a life for a life makes little sense in our society, nor does one for many. No matter how horrible the crime, we cannot honor the victims nor offer them closure by terminating the criminal. The only way is to ensure that the criminal spend his or her time thinking on the crime that they committed and hope that the message eventually hits home. I also believe that the death penalty is used in a racially prejudicial manner and does not reflect its true intent and therefore serves little purpose."
"I believe in the death penalty for unjust murderers because of the following: First, the death penalty serves as a deterrent to would-be murderers. Second, unjust murderers should not be allowed to live if they have taken human life for no just reason. Third, it is too expensive and an unfair burden on taxpayers to keep unjust murderers alive."
""I believe that the death penalty is a reasonable punishment for some crimes.  There are people out there who imagine that they can do anything they'd like to other human beings without suffering any consequences.  Those people should be punished when they knowingly go against the law and hurt other human beings.  Although a court should acknowledge that person's background and look at psychological factors in their upbringing, the excuse of ""it's my parent's fault"" can only go so far.  Sometimes one must take responsibility for their own actions. ""
"The death penalty is not a deterrant to crime.  It exists only to fulfill the oft misinterpreted eye-for-an-eye mentality listed in the Bible.  When in truth, it is only God that can judge our actions.  The laws of God transcend and supercede the laws of man."
"I completely disagree with the death penalty and I think it should be abolished. If a criminal is going to commit a crime worthy of the death penalty, they should have to spend the rest of their life locked up in a prison cell. I see the death penalty as a way out of a crime, not as a punishment. Although the person in question would most definitely go to Hell(if in fact there is such a place) but I see it as more of a punishment to force them to live and think about what they've done for the rest of their lives."
"The death penalty is a necessary deterrent in today's criminal justice system. It must be used sparingly though. There are a handful of convicted felons who have committed crimes so heinous and without remorse, that they do not deserve to live. Jeffery Dahmer was such a person. Though he was given a life sentence, the inmates in the institution would up killing him in a far more inhumane way than the death penalty would have prescribed."
"The death penalty is an archaic and wrong method of punishment. There are a variety of reasons why the death penalty should not be used. For one, many prisoners on Death Row were convicted based on eyewitness evidence only. Research shows that eyewitness accounts can be inaccurate. How many Death Row prisoners have been convicted unfairly? Additionally, multiple Death Row prisoners have been exonerated based on DNA evidence. In my opinion, one innocent person who has died on Death Row is too many. Additionally, the death penalty costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year in legal fees for prisoners on appeal. Also, the most common form of the death penalty, the lethal injection, is generally not performed by licensed medical professionals and may be administered in such a way that it causes the prisoner great pain, violating the law against cruel and unusual punishment. Finally, the death penalty is not a good deterrent for people who commit crimes that would land you on death row. The rates of these crimes are not going down any."
"The death penalty because it is morally wrong. No human being should take a life of another as punishment. It does not deter crime if it did there would be any murders. Death does is not a just punishment."
"For me, the death penalty debate is not a question of what is morally right or wrong. It is a question of what the best punishment for the crime would be. In many cases you hear about a murderer or criminal committing suicide prior to being taken into police custody. I believe that these criminals realize they are going to go to prison for a long time and would rather face death. Therefore, one could conclude that for the majority of criminals facing a life sentence in prison without the possibility of parole is a much harsher fate than facing death. Which leads me in favor of life in prison vs. the death penalty. In other facts, putting someone to death costs three times more money than keeping someone in prison for life. "
"While I believe the death penalty is a valid form of punishment, I feel that it ultimately fails in its central purpose.  The idea is that it\u2019s supposed to deter individuals from performing the acts that would lead to the punishment, and since there are folks who are sentenced to death it is obviously not working as a deterrent.  Also, it has become far too expensive in our society to put someone to death.  The appeal process (put in place to make sure we don\u2019t sentence a person wrongly) is long and expensive, and paid for by tax dollars.  It is actually cheaper to keep someone in prison then it is to execute them.  So while I believe in the death penalty in principal I feel that it should be abolished under our current legal system."
""I believe in the death penalty under certain circumstances. The people who kill others deserve the death penalty, considering the ""an eye for an eye"" theory. Also people who harm children deserve the death penalty in my opinion. If anyone deserves the death penalty it is the people who harm children or other people. ""
"I think the death penalty should be aborted throughout the world as no one has the right to end someone else's life. Misjudgements can occur resulting in death penalties for innocent people which cannot be reversed and compensation can not be enough for a life taken away. Whatever crime committed, locking someone behind bars for the rest of their life can be enough."
""There will always be a lot of debate about the death penalty as long as there are Christians in the world.  The Old Testament says ""an eye for an eye..."" but the New Testament says ""Love your neighbor as yourself.""  If God can't be consistent, how can mere humans be expected to feel?  I am against the death penalty simply because I believe it's wrong to take a life.  I'm not sure if this is a view I have come to because I'm older now, or what has made me develop in this way.  Perhaps as I've gotten older, I've become more willing to make allowances for people because I would want that kind of mercy for myself if the situation were reversed.  ""
"I believe that the death penalty is a very serious punishment and should not be taken lightly. However, I think that all states should have the option rather than just a few, I don't think that it's fair to the public to have the difference. I think it is a detterant to serious and violent crime where it is practiced. Certain crimes like murder and rape deserve the death penalty when it is ruled that a criminal cannot be rehabilitated and re-enter society."
""I believe that society should have the death penalty, not so much as the ultimate deterrent (I'm not sure that it acts as a deterrent), but as the ultimate punishment for crimes against humanity. The question then needs to be posed: what constitutes a crime against humanity. That would ultimately be for the lawmakers to determine, but premeditated (first degree) murder would, I imagine fall into this category whereas a crime of passion, committed in the heat of the moment, would not. Without the ultimate punishment, there is no leverage; there is no significance attributed to ultimate crimes and perpetrators of evil acts will not have their acts recognised as such. There would be no distinction between their wrongdoing and lesser acts.""
"The death penalty, although harsh, I think is necessary.  Some people simply can not handle themselves in society.  Most of these people have psychological problems that can not be solved.  The only alternative would be to let these people live in prison, but often that sentence would only degrade their condition by forcing them to interact with people of negative influence.  The death penalty is never a pleasant choice, but occasionally can be the most civil."
"I believe the death penalty is a neccessity to justice and humanity.  I firmly believe that if your crimes are henious enough, for example killing someone else or child molestation, that you should not have the luxury of living out your days.  Some people say it is the easy way out, that you dont have to face years of punishment if you are faced with the death penalty, but I dont see that.  Nothing is worse than realizing you are going to die and wondering about your own fate in the afterlife.  Even those who are not religious have to wonder what will happen when they die.  I believe that is why most criminals turn to religion in prison, for fear that it does exist and they will be faced with damnation afterwards.  Even living in a jail or prison is living.  If it was as horrible as death, more people on death row would just be suicidal.  No one wants to die, and I believe in a life for a life.  In cases such as child molestation and henious rapes, even though you may not have technically taken a life, you have in the end.  I was a victim of molestation and rape as a child and a large part of my life has been taken away.  I no longer get to be a normal person with normal fears and normal relationships.  My life will be spent suffering from those moments and I believe it is much the same way for other victims.  To a degree I guess I am saying an eye for an eye, someone who takes anothers life does not deserve to have their own."
"Whether or not some murderers are deserving of the death penalty is irrelevant.  The issue with the death penalty is that our legal system isn't full proof, that is, that innocent people are sentenced and sometimes executed for crimes they did not commit.   Until such a system is in place, that ensures that innocent people are not slaughtered by the government, we should not allow people to be killed by our hands.  And anyone who advocates the death penalty, while understanding that innocents are killed, and who still claim that that's an okay price to pay, should prove it by allowing one of their children to be executed by the state.  Unless they're willing to do so, then they're TRULY don't believe what they are saying."
"If someone has committed a crime heinous enough to be sentenced to death, then they should be sentenced to death. I think that the death penalty should be a sentence for people that have committed crimes other than murder. Crimes such as child or sexual abuse should also be punished to death. We don't need people that would do things like that in our gene pool any more."
"The death penalty uses the fear of punishment as a means of teaching others a lesson or keeping others from committing the same crime. By doing this, the government attempts to scare people into doing the right thing. Certain psychological studies have shown that using this tactic is not very successful though. Rewards for good behavior work much better than punishing bad behaviors. I am not saying that rapists and murderers should be set free, but I am saying that they should not be put to death. Considering that there will always be error in the criminal justice system, and no one can ever be proven 100% guilty, the death penalty kills innocent lives. I think it should be abolished because killing one life doesn't make another murder go away. It simply adds to the problem."
"The death penalty does not effectively deter violent crime, and is an injustice to the victims and their families, and in fact all of society.  The purpose of the judicial system should be to extract renumeration from criminals, as well as to rehabilitate.  The death penalty eliminates the possibility of either, permanently.  Furthermore, statistics show that the death penalty has no deterrent effect, probably because most crimes that are punishable by the death penalty are committed in acts of passion, impulse, or percieved necessity.  Finally, the permanence of the death penalty eliminates the possibility of exhoneration of the truly innocent in the case that new evidence or techniques arise, such as DNA evidence."
"In certain cases, capital punishment or the death penalty is the only appropriate consequence. The criminal justice system is used to appropriately punish those who have committed societal injustices. It is also, therefore a method to set and example of just punishment for certain crimes so heinous that should never be repeated. As a society, all persons should be accountable for their actions and there is nothing more serious than taking the life of an individual, and should result in an appropriate punishment."
"I believe that the death penalty can be a necessary evil. It should be reserved for the most heinous of crimes, however. I believe it has it's place with criminals who meet certain criteria. First, their crime must be so apparent that there is not even sliver of a doubt regarding their guilt. The death penalty should not be used if there is even a .001% chance that they are innocent. Second, the crime must warrant the punishment and the criminal must be a true and present danger to society- so dangerous that any other punishment besides death could put society at risk. Last, the death penalty should be as quick and painless as possible. Regardless of a person's crime, torture, pain, and suffering is not the answer."
"I do not believe in the death penalty. It costs more to put a person to death than to lock them up for the rest of their lives. It would be more punishment to the criminal to force them to live their life in prison and knowing why they are there. Often times innocent people are convicted of a crime they did not commit. If they were put to death and found innocent, there could be no way of reversing this. It is not our place as humans to decide life and death."
""Putting someone to death after being convicted of a haneous crime is not only warrented but necessary. For some criminals, life behind bars is not a punishment as intended, but an accepted way of life.  Justice is not served by sending a vicious criminal into the prison system where he is fed, clothed, and recives better medical care than most of free America.  When a child is murdered, when an innocent is slain, when repeat violent offenders are incarcerated that is not justice.  They have no remorse and they don't learn a lesson other than ""don't get caught next time.""""
"In our modern society, the death penalty has proven to be a barbaric, expensive, and faulty punishment for serious crimes. The foremost reason that that the death penalty is wrong is that man should not be the arbiter of life and have no right to put down a fellow human being like a dog. Also, a death penalty sentence has also become a very expensive proposition due to the lengthy appeals process. It would be less of a financial burden to put someone away for life. Finally, with science always advancing, we are bound to come across more instances where advanced DNA testing and other forensic tests may be able to find innocence in later years. Death takes away any chance for a wrongly accused person to be found innocent. "
""The death penalty should be enforced.  I ask the question ""How do people serve MULTIPLE LIFE SENTENCES?""  On the news you hear that some one has been given 3 life sentences.  I ask my self how do they serve that term?  The best way is to enforce the death penalty at an eye for an eye level.  If the person was killed for example with a knife then they should be killed the same way.  That and having the death penalty on the books is cheaper in most cases then letting a 20-50 year old serve a life term or more.  If you figure that each person with a life sentence requires $15.00 per day to house / feed / locked up and you do that year in and year out for 20-30+ years that ends up costing tax payers over $100,000 to keep them in jail.  Where as the putting them to death will only cost tax payers a fraction of that.""
""I believe the death penalty is a proper and necessary act for our government to take to rid the world of evil people. In fact, in my honest opinion we don't use it enough. Many people turn to religious reasons, or nature to dispute the death penalty, I for one can use both of those things to argue for it. For the religious folks who argue that it's a sin, I can point to the quote from the Bible, ""an eye for an eye"". And for those who thinks it goes against nature to kill any living being I can use the term from Darwin, ""survival of the fittest"". Some people just simply arent fit to live in our society and have no intent to do anything but harm others with their lives. So in conclusion I say the Death Penalty is necessary and right.""
"I think that the death penalty is a good thing. Let's take the Bible's opinion on the matter. It says in the case of murder, that there should be an eye for an eye. This means to me that if a person murders another person, they should have their life taken away. Let the punishment fit the crime. In this country I think the judicial system is too lenient on murders, only giving them a slap on the wrist most of the time. "
"I believe in the death penalty because I really feel that some people have done such horrendous things that they should not be allowed the slightest chance of ever getting out of prison to repeat themselves.  And even if they can never be paroled, they could break out of prison.  I think if there was a chance that this person could feel remorse and suffer for what they have done, then having them live would be the greater punishment , but if they show no remorse then do not show tender feelings to them.  Some people delight in reliving the unspeakable things they do and they should not be allowed to live at our expense so they can enjoy their memories over and over again.  They have shown their total disregard for the humanness of all of us. "
"The death penalty is a needed tool to punish criminals to the fullest extent of the law.  A death sentence protects other prisoners from criminals deemed unsafe to socialize in a confined setting.  It also frees up space in the jails by a shorter housing time on a convicted felon that otherwise could be in the system for 30-50 years.  The fear factor of knowing that your life could be ended by being convicted of a heinous crime could also play a part in negotiating information out of a person on trial for a life sentence instead."
"I truly believe that death penalty must be given to people who are criminals of the worst kind. Criminals who have deliberately killed someone or have raped someone or has taken the path of terrorism to spread hatred amongst people, do not deseserve sympathy of any kind.  Man is endowed with intelligence to differentiate right from wrong and evil from just.  Despite being an intelligent being, if he still commits such hienous crimes, a man does not deserve sympathy. If I could I would kill him over and over again."
"I truly believe that only God can take a life.  Therefore I cannot allow the State of Connecticut to murder a human in my name.  I am absolutely opposed to death penalties.  To use this punishment for whatever crime returns us to a state predating civilization.  I would feel this way even if the heinous crime was done to my family.  It is wrong and speaks to the worst in human nature and damages everyone who participates in such an act."
"The death penalty is a not a necessary evil as some would say. To take a life is not something required of the criminal justice system. Are some crimes beyond unthinkable? Yes, but doesn't the taking of a life fall into that same group? I'm not arguing that those found guilty of crimes of this magnitude are able to be rehabilitated. I simply believe that that we have a moral imperative to avoid sentences such as the death penalty."
"My true belief on death penalty is it must be aborted.we cannot take life as a punishment.if someone killed somebody we cannot kill him because he or she has a life to live in.so death penalty is not the accurate solution."
"Even though some cases of human cruelty have me wonder, I generally think death penalty is abominy. If you can't be granted a number of basic rights that nothing and nobody can take from you (and life, of course, is the first one), then you can't be granted anything. Also, if punishment is what we're looking for, I think there are better ways to punish people: life imprisonment in my opinion is way worse than simple death. On the other hand, if you condemn the worst man on Earth to death, you will never know if one day he would've sought redemption and possibly become a better person."
""The death penalty provides the opportunity to follow the belief of ""an eye for an eye"" at the most basic level. An individual sentenced to the death penalty loses their choice for life, in much the same way the individual removed the choice or life from their victim. The death penalty costs the state roughly the same amount of money as housing a prisoner for life, meaning it should not be seen as an economic decision to alleviate overcrowding at prisons. The death penalty should be seen as a way to deter criminals from committing the most horrific of crimes. ""
"The death penalty should be completely abolished.  Even for the most serious offenses an alternate form of punishment should be given.  Killing someone in self defense at the moment one's life is endangered is commonly held to be acceptable, but few people would condone hunting down someone after the fact and killing them.  This is essentially what we are doing when the death penalty is put into use, it is accepted because the person has been found guilty through the legal system, however in the end it is essentially the same as if the victim had put the criminal to death after their life was no longer in danger.  Many people say that the death penalty is more cost effective than keeping a person alive in prison for life, however I have seen statistics that say this is not so.  Some sources state that the personnel, equipment, and drugs needed for an execution far exceed the costs of keeping a prisoner alive. "
"I believe that the death penalty should not be used as a punishment in the United States. It has been shown that the death penalty does nothing to deter violent crime and, in fact, there is often more violent crime in areas where the death penalty is legal. One must also consider the reality that our legal system will never be perfect and innocent people are sometimes convicted of crimes they did not commit. In these circumstances, it often takes years for the truth to come to light. In cases such as this where innocent convict was sentenced to death, often the person is put to death before their innocence is revealed. Because we rely on humans to convict criminals, the system will never be perfect. Therefore, there is too much risk in using the death penalty as a sentence."
"I once read in a fiction book about someone who accidentally killed a friend that it was a worse punishment to live with the mistake than to die and be free of it.  I agree with that idea, but I'm not sure if it would be applicable here. The Death Penalty is administered in the most severe of severe cases to the most guilty of the guilty.  At that stage, are the people in line for the death penalty aware, caring of, or sorry for what they have done?  If someone was mentally ill and in line for the death penalty, is that right?  I'm not saying that mental illness is an excuse, I'm asking if it was entirely that person's fault.  I feel that the death penalty should be used sparingly, only for people who had the intent to kill and the intent to continue killing.  These people area danger to society.  On the other hand, I do not believe that people who have no control over what they do should be given the death penalty.  If someone is unaware that they killed someone due to a mental illness, do they deserve death themselves?  I know this question would mean nothing to the family of the victim, but it is something to consider.  If there is a way to deal with an unaware or nintentional killer without giving them the death penalty, I think those means should be employed.  "
"In my opinion, I think the death penalty is an appropriate form of punishment in our legal system. I believe the death penalty is a proper form of justice for serious crimes, such as multiple homicides, rape, torture etc. In my opinion, I think the death penalty rids our society of our most dangerous criminals and keeps our streets safe. In addition to this, I also believe that the death penalty acts as a possible deterrent to would-be criminals. I also believe that the death penalty gives District Attorneys around the country more leverage to prosecute crimes. When working out a plea bargain with a suspect of homicide, DA's can offer life-imprisonment in lieu of the death penalty to suspects, and suspects in turn can give law enforcement valuable information regarding other crimes.   "
""The death penalty in my opinion is the best thing that a state could ever enforce. Especially the way that a lot of society has become with no morals. With murders, home invasions, armed robberys, and just about every other major crime at an all time high the death penalty is the answer in my opinion to deterring some of these crime from happening in the first place. Another reason I favor the death penalty is there are so many child abductions and murders and child rapes going on. Anyone who would harm a defenseless child should definately in my opinion be put to death as soon as they are convicted of the crime. I am not super religious but in these cases I definately believe in the ""Eye for and Eye"" quote out of the Bible.""
"The death penalty is important in our legal system. For the family of the victims it will give them closure that justice was served. If a criminal goes to jail there is a chance he will escape and commit more crimes. The death penalty is a great crime deterrant. "
"Thou shall not kill. This is one of the 10 commandments and applies to all humans including those humans who have broken this commandment themselves. Taking another human's life by murder or enacting the death penalty which is murder also is morally wrong. There is no justification in ending a life even when a law permits it. There are so many cases of possibly innocent people dying as a result of the death penalty. Innocent or doubtably guilty criminals are still human beings and should not be murdered, yes murdered by the state enacting a death penalty sentence. Murder is murder no matter if it is from an government paid official, a doctor or a person from the street."
"I am definatly for the death penalty but only for the most horrific offenders.  I think that murderers should suffer their own fate and be put to death.  I don't think they should be allowed to spend the rest of their lives in prison.  I think they should be executed soon after conviction."
"Death penalty should be given to crimes of highest orders.It serves another purpose.It creates a state of fear in other like criminals/ crime thinking people.It would thus helps in reducing crimes and lowering crime rates.In a certain study, it was found that society with death punishments had low crime rates."
"The fear of a death penalty does not appear to have much effect on criminals' decisions.  If they are in a situation where they are about to commit a death-penalty crime, it does not appear to deter their behavior.  If asked whether they thought about the penalty before committing the crime, I doubt that the inmates on death row would have decided not to commit it because they knew they could get the death penalty.  Besides, it is wrong for the state to put a person to death.  In my opinion, it is tantamount to murder, and that is a crime when anyone, including the state, commits it!  Rather than murdering an inmate, life in prison without parole should suffice to keep the public safe from hardened criminals."
"Death penalties in my opinion, should be banned outright.  Though our blood boils at the intensity of the crime committed by the offender, this extreme penalty is by no means a solution to the perpetration of the crime.  In the instant case, we are assuming the position of God, and allow no chance or scope for the criminal to reform or atone for his sins.  Every human being, should be given an opportunity to admit his guilt and turn over a new leaf.  To this extent, a system should be put in place to facilitate the transformation.  Effective rehabilitation centers are an answer to this malady.  Kill a man, you have avenged yourselves.  Reform a man, you become God's direct deputy."
""I do not support the death penalty for a multitude of reasons.  The first reason is data does not support  a decrease in the number of violent crimes committed when the death penalty is used as a deterrent.  This is very similar to the data that increased accessabily to guns does not result in decreased violence in society.   The 2nd reason is the legal system is not perfect and has resulted in innocent people being convicted for violent crimes.  This is especially true in parts of the US where racism is a more obvious part of the social fiber.  The third reason is I do not believe in a spiritual tradition of ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.""  Instead, the time spent incarcerated with loss of choice, loss of personal, daily contact with family and friends, and loss of freedom is the biggest penalty that can be endured.  ""
"I am opposed to the death penalty. The argument that this form of punishment works as a deterrent has been disproved by rising crime rates, and is meaningless in the face of spree killers and sadists who do not consider the consequences of their actions. The United States Constitution guarantees a right to 'Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness', which seems at odds with the idea of allowing the State or Federal government to take lives, and citizens are supposed to be protected from 'cruel and unusual punishment'. There have been many shocking cases concerning the execution of juveniles and the mentally ill. But in my opinion the most important argument against the death penalty is that we cannot guarantee that every person executed has had a fair trial or is guilty of the offense they are charged with. If we take just one innocent life then we, as a nation, have committed murder. "
"The death penalty is a just punishment for certain crimes and offenders. If a human has the capacity to not only break a known law but to end another humans life in an unjust fashion without just cause, then they also knowingly forfeit their rights as a law abiding citizen and as a human with the right to life. The death penalty not only eliminates future threats from a known murderer but also ends the needless suffering of the victims loved ones by relieving them of the pain endured each time they know they must continue to deal with the fact that the murderer is still alive and well. The death penalty also serves as a deterrent for committing murder and saves on tax dollars that would be spent on keeping the convict imprisoned. With today's technology and DNA testing the errors in convictions has diminished significantly. Any person committing such a heinous crime should know that they are also committing themselves to the same fate as their victim."
"Killing someone for a crime is committing a crime yourself. No matter how someone justifies it, it is still murder. It doesn't remove the crime or the effects of it. A dead person is still dead. A person with psychological trauma won't be healed. As the justice system is not perfect, some of the people sitting in jail on death row are innocent, so not only do criminals die, innocent people as well. Killing criminals serves to strengthen this idea that some people deserve to die. Who are the people that deserve to die? A racist would say any one not of their race. A gangster might say rival gang members. If humans build a culture of respect for human life, then murder would be less likely as it would become morally a more serious crime. The death penalty can't teach that. It only teaches a disregard for someone's life and a feeling of justification for the murder of someone else."
"I think the death penalty is an immoral and dangerous form of punishment that does little to prevent the occurance of crime.  I believe that the individuals who commit these most haneous of crimes are thinking little about the possibility of dying as a punishment for their offence.  They are probably so consumed with rage or compulsion, or whatever it is that's driving them, and not getting caught.  The idea of the death penalty versus life in prison won't stop them from committing the crime in the first rate. Unfortunately, the legal system will never be perfect.  There will always be guilty people going free and innocent people being convicted.  I think that even one innnocent person being put to death is too high a price to pay.  What if you or someone you love is in the wrong place at the wrong time one day?  Can you imagine lying on that table waiting to be legally executed for something you had no part in.  Exactly how many have been through that horror.  It's just not worth the risk.   "
"The death penalty is a barbaric practice that has no place in a modern, civilized society.  With the exception of the US, the death penalty has been abolished by all Western nations and by the vast majority of the world's societies.  The main argument used by supporters of the death penalty - that it is a deterrent to people who are considering committing a crime - has been repeatedly proven false in studies.  Furthermore, due to inequity and corruption in our legal system, we now know that many innocent individuals have been sentenced to death, some even executed, for crimes they did not commit.  There are other ways to punish the guilty that are more effective and that are not irreversible should the convicted person later be exonerated.  As no plausible argument can be made for the usefulness of the death penalty, and since there is a significant risk that it will be applied to persons who did not commit the crimes they were convicted of, it is completely irrational to continue the practice."
"I support the death penalty.  While the vast majority of crimes do not warrant the death penalty being used, there are rare exceptions.  I would approve, for example, of those responsible for 9/11 or similar mass killings being put to the death, rather than allowing these individuals to live.  The death penalty also serves as a useful deterrent in stopping crimes.  If an individual believes that there is a chance that he will be put to the death if caught, as opposed to living out his life in prison with the chance for escape or parole, there is a greater chance that the individual will not commit his crimes."
""I believe in the death penalty. I know that this is an issue that is very contraversal but I don't think that all people get it. If someone gets life in prison for taking the life of someone else, a man, women, or even a child, they have a chance of parole. Now think about that, what if someone killed your child, and 10 years later got out? How would you feel? If they receive the death penalty you know in your heart that there is no way that will ever happen again to someone elses child, or maybe even your other child. I believe in the saying ""an eye for an eye.""  People are aware of what they do and if they arn't then they should have been in a mental hospitial instead of on the streets killing innocent people. Those are my truthful feelings on the death penalty.""
""The death penalty is a punishment that must be held up in a court of law.  People who do crimes against ""humanity"" deserve death for there is no other punishment that could be handed down to justify the means.  Providing room and board, free education, free health and dental,  and access to the public via internet, paid for by the ones that have been violated, is not punishment.  The death penalty appeals need to cease, they are promised and given a swift trial, give them a swift death.  ""Justice For All"" not ""Justice For All, Except""...""
""The death penalty is man's attempt to play God and exact judgments the likes of which he has no business doing.  An estimated (insert number here)% of ALL death row inmates are INNOCENT regardless of what a district judge or a jury of their peers may think of them.  The simple fact is, if ONE PERSON does not see, hear, smell, feel, or in some other tactile way experience the crime taking place when it took place, then that ONE PERSON cannot say with any certainty if the person being accused is in fact guilty or not;  let alone 12 of them.  It stand to reason that Sally Homemaker could have fallen down the stairs and impaled herself on the knife she was carrying, making it appear as though she had been beaten and stabbed when in fact she was actually only half drunk and clumsy -or- her husband may have snapped and brutally killed her in a drunken rage.  Who knows for sure?  God.  Only God.  We kill who knows how many men every year in situations exactly like the one just described and in (insert number here)% of those cases, we are WRONG.  Dead Wrong.  In this way, we are no better than the criminals we are trying to eliminate, and worse of still for all the good men we lose to this process.""
"The death penalty is a barbaric practice that should be abolished because it can not undo any damage that a convicted person may have done. Since it neither undoes deeds nor prevents others from doing the same type of deeds, its only purpose is to eliminate the problem by eliminating the perpetrator. There has to be another way to punish someone besides executing them in order to keep society safe. There should be a way that someone who is sentenced to die can atone for the crime and benefit society and be spared the death penalty. The death penalty is nothing but a quick fix for people who are seek revenge and see those who are condemned as less worthy of rehabilitation than some animals. The more often the death penalty is used, the lower the value of human life becomes. It is truly upsetting to find out that some people have been executed in error and that this is one penalty that can\u2019t be reversed. The death penalty is not a solution for dealing with mentally ill convicts anymore. This horrific punishment is a carry over from ancient times when people did not understand anything about mental illness or value human life in the same manner that civilized people do today. "
"I do not believe the death penalty is just.  I do not think it is fair to take someone's physical life into your hands and play god.  Lifetime sentences in jail are more fair while not playing devil's advocate.  While punishment is just by sentencing people for their behavior, taking their life into your hands is much more invasive."
"I am not always sure what I feel about the death penalty.  If I had to choose I would be against it.  Killing someone does not make any sense.  I have never been in a situation where someone I love has been hurt.  So I have never been personally involved in a death penalty situation.  If the person is trully sorry I don't think they should be killed , but not allowed to be free ever again."
"The issue of Death Penalty has been debated for years now. The question? Is it right or not to impose Death Penalty? For me I don't believe in Death Penalty. I still believe that it's not in our hands to judge whether that person is doomed to die for the crime that he did. Only God has the right to tell whether our lives stop this very minute or we live till we are ripe of age. Of course a person has to suffer the consequence of what he has done but DEATH is not the answer to it."
"Is it better to kill an innocent man or to let a guilty man live the remainder of his life in prison with no chance of parole?  To me, the answer to this question is simple.  The government should always hold that not punishing an innocent man is more important that extracting the maximum punishment from a guilty one.  Letting a murderer live the rest of his life in a 9 by 10 cell may seem too lenient, but compared to the chance that the state executes an innocent man, it is no contest.  And no matter how careful the courts are in its rendering of justice, there is always the chance that the jury will decide incorrectly and send an innocent man to his death."
