"Doctor Aboolian is a board-certified plastic surgeon. I decided to have my cosmetic surgery performed by him after reading a number of reviews by his patients and investigating his medical credentials. I was impressed by the number of glowing reviews and his academic background and made an appointment. I'm thrilled with the results! The staff were all wonderful and allayed my nervousness and jitters. The offices are pleasant and enjoyable to be in. After my initial consultation, I knew I had made the right decision. Seeing the final results definitely confirmed that."
"I'll be honest, when I was first looking for doctors for cosmetic surgery i was a bit nervous. I have always wanted to have a breast enlargement. I thought that they would judge and laugh at me. I was also worried about the cost. But one day while talking to a coworker of mine about cosmetic surgery, she told me that she knew a friend who knows a surgeon who she swears by. I was a little reluctant when I made the appointment call and first talked to the receptionist. As I kept talking to her and asking her questions I felt more and more comfortable with this office. So then I scheduled an appointment for the next day and went into the office. I was called in the room almost immediately and then met Dr. Luna. He was the nicest person I have ever met in my life, no joke. He was so easy to talk to and answered all my silly questions and calmed my worries. We also discussed payment options that lets me make low monthly payments that I can afford. And then let me tell you, the surgery was a big success! I look fabulous and would have gone through this whole experience again. I would like to give a BIG thanks to Dr. Luna and Lola (the receptionist) for all their help. I would recommend Dr. Luna to anyone who wants or is even considering cosmetic surgery. He is THE best!"
"My name is Samantha. I needed to get laser hair removal done on my upper lip and the back of my head. I have heard good reviews about the Epiderma online clinic so I decided to look into it. I made an appointment with Doctor Fernando Luna, went in and despite the fact that I've been going to doctors for most of my life, I was still a little nervous. He was able to keep me calm, explain the full procedure and how long the procedure lasts. Needless to say, it was a hassle free and pain free experience. I would highly recommend going to this clinic for any various cosmetic needs you would need. They have excellent service as well as excellent doctors. Thank you."
"I recently visited with Dr. Fernando Luna for treatment of my varicose veins. I was very impressed with the office. The staff was friendly and made me feel at home during my procedure. Dr. Luna was prompt and professional. I am very pleased with the outcome of my procedure and have already recommended his services to several friends. "
"Dr. Fernando Luna cares about and listens to me in regards to my health care. I feel like he knows just the right thing to keep me healthy and happy. Thank you Dr. Fernado Luna!"
"I called to make an appointment with Dr. Luna to see him for my vericose veins and was able to get in within one week. After arriving, I was taken back to his examining room within 15 minutes. I only had to wait another 15 minutes for him to arrive in the room. Dr. Luna very clearly explained the process I would undergo and all of the alternatives. He told me what to expect before, during, and after and patiently answered my questions. I would definetly recommend Dr. Luna to anyone!"
"Fernando Luna is a godsend. The varicose veins I have are not hurting like they once did. This is truly a gift to me. His practices in medicine are outstanding. I would recommend Fernando Luna to anyone. I was told he is in practice for nearly 30 years. He knows his stuff for sure. I am not one to really write reviews on the computer but I had to this time. I wanted to make sure that everyone who sees this will not hesitate to see Fernando Luna whenever possible. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"Dr. Luna is a great doctor. Not only does he help with my ailment and treat me, but he goes above and beyond to connect with me and make me comfortable. He always takes time to ask me about my life and asks about my grandchildren. The wait time is consistently less than 10 minutes. His support staff is very nice and professional. Even though he is a very popular doctor, he still works me in when I really need to be seen."
"I love this medical office. Issues such as these are so delicate and personal. Both my husband and I felt very comfortable to talk to this staff about our personal needs. I have some problems with unsightly varicose veins and my partner has a lot of hair removal needs. If you are looking for a tactful, confidential doctors office for such issues and want kind, attentive service, just visit the online website or make an appointment. You'll be glad you did."
" Due to many years of being on my feet I started getting vericose veins in my calves. At first they were just unsightly but after awhile I developed complications and my legs started swelling. I contacted The Epiderma clinic and met with Dr. Fernando Luna. He made me feel completely comfortable and was very knowledgeable about my condition. It is more common than I realized. We set up an appointment for an ultrasound so he could diagnose the extent of the probelm. Dr. Fernando Luna communicated with me every step of the way and talked to me in a way I could understand. On the day of the surgery Dr. Fernando Luna and his staff took great care of me. My legs look 20 years younger thanks to Dr. Fernando Luna! I couldn't be happier!"
"When my wife and I found at that she was pregnant we decided to visit Dr. Francois Lacombe. We went based on other reviews we had read and we were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and we were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable we were with Dr. Lacombe. He delivered our son and everything went wonderfully throughout the entire pregnancy and delivery. We were treated respectfully and the entire staff gave us support and understanding at all times. At one visit Dr. Lacombe even waived his normal $20 fee for us being late to the appointment! We will definitely be using his services again for our next pregnancy and my wife will continue to see him for her obstetric and family practice needs. We would highly recommend Francois Lacombe to anyone looking for a new Doctor."
"I have been a patient of Dr Angela Mazza-Whelan for 10 years. Dr Mazza-Whelan has always provided myself and my family with exceptional medical care. She is a very skilled practitioner, which shows not only in her posted degrees, and Internal Medicine Board Certified certificates, but also in her hands on, caring, bedside manner. I feel she upholds the company's vision of a "Healthier Hamilton" I highly recommend Dr. Mazza-Whelan to anyone in the community who is seeking a new family doctor."
" Dr.Francois Lacombe has a great bedside manor and listens to all your complaints. He is very compassionate, knowledgeable and caring. He is excellent at expanding what is wrong and how they are going to fix it. He is there for you every step of the way from diagnosis to procedure all the way to a cure. Appointments are scheduled in a timely manner and he keeps his appointments your wait is never long. I would recommend Dr Francois Lacombe to all my friends and relatives, he is a great doctor. "
"My son had been fighting a cough for several weeks before we decided it was bad enough to see a doctor for it. We were a little worried that he may have bronchitis. At 2 years old, you wish your kid was not sick at all and you are almost scared for them. Unfortunately we were new to the area and did not know any doctors in the area. Since being here though, we had established a number of relationships that I would consider friends. When we asked around, Dr. Lacombe's name was very popular among the results. We felt that if others around us were having good experiences with him and how he handles the children, then it can't hurt for us to try. I was still hesitant though as I have had very negative experiences with several other doctors. When I made the appointment, the nurse was very cordial. From the moment I walked in the door I felt at home rather than a doctor's office. They had all up-to-date equipment for many types of medical appointments. The nurses that built a chart and asked my son questions were very nice and knew how to work with kids. Dr. Lacombe was one of the nicest doctor's I have ever worked with and after a few quick tests he knew what was wrong with my son. He gave my son a sucker and a smile and made my son and I feel a little more comfortable. He prescribed us some antibiotics and his cough was cleared up in about 3 days. I would definitely recommend Dr. Lacombe. I have two other children that will be seeing Dr. Lacombe as well as my wife. It will take some convincing on her end, but I think that I can win her over. I have done it once before! Thank you Dr. Lacombe and staff! You made us feel very welcome in an area full of strangers. We look forward to seeing you again next time one of our children is in need of medical care."
"Dr. Lacombe is such an amazing doctor. He has been a family physician for so long that I feel very comfortable and I always listen to his advice. During my pregnancy, he was very supportive and helpful when he spoke with me and my husband.There were also times that I needed an urgent appointment and he was always available to tend to my worries and needs. He made sure that he was with me during every stage of my pregnancy. Since I have delivered my lovely baby girl, I have been recommending him to my friends. I had the best experience with Dr. Lacombe!"
"Doctor Francois Lacombe practices family medicine and specializes in obstetrics. While he does practice family medicine, he only accepts new pregnancy patients now. Very experienced, he has delivered more than 5,000 babies! Try and make your initial appointment two to four months in advance, but if that is not possible you can make an urgent appointment through his secretary. He practices out of Polyclinic Medical Concorde and has around 2,000 patients. Since he practices with six other doctors, a physician is always available when you need one. "
"Dr. Lacombe was attentive to all of my basic needs. He was there immediately to help me through the drawn out process of my pregnancy and in the end he lead me through the initial process of birthing my child. He was calm and collective and I recommend him to anyone in need of a caring family doctor. I feel that he's been fair through all payment processes and I've not second guessed my decision on who I've chosen as my doctor."
"I highly recommend Dr. Lacombe to anyone I know, especially my close friends and family. This doctor is not good, he is fantastic! I have never been treated with such kindness and compassion from any medical professional until I had an appointment with this doctor. He is very knowledgeable, yet humble. As soon as he saw my swollen leg, he became concerned and asked me to take my socks off. He pressed his hands from my thigh and swiftly rand his hands towards my foot. Dr. Lacombe mentioned I had poor circulation since my feet were quite cold compared to my legs. He diagnosed me with diabetes which matched my other symptoms (abnormal insulin levels, constant thirst, etc.) perfectly. How he knows so much is beyond me. It's a wonderful feeling to know that there are dedicated medical professionals who actually care about their patients. Thank you Dr. Lacombe!"
"Doctor Francois Lacombe, was the utmost professional when it came to helping my wife and I bring our brand new baby boy into this world. going above and beyond what we had expected walking into his office in order to make our family only as we could have dreamed of."
"I had an excellent experience with Dr. Francois Lacombe at the Polyclinique Medicale Concorde. It has been a delight working with him during the births of my children. He has a wonderful bedside manner, good hours, and an excellent network of referral services when he is unavailable. For those seeking an obstetrician in the Montreal-Laval area, I would highly recommend Dr. Lacombe. "
"Dr. Lacombe is a family physician at the Polyclinic Medical Concorde. He has been my family's obstetrician through three pregnancies, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. With many doctors you get the feeling that they are simply putting in their time for the day, and in their dealings with you they make you feel like a bother. Not Dr. Lacombe. He is unfailingly kind, respectful, and truly wants to help you with any worries or concerns that you may have. "
"Since 2005 I have been looking for a medical treatment/checkup facility with both the welcomeness of a family doctor & the professionalism of a respected private practice. This is when I found the Family Health Teams in Ontario. Upon arrival at the facility, I was immediately impressed by the overall knowledge by all staff. I met my doctor, Francois Viviers on my first visit when I had a broken a bone in my foot during a home softball game & he has been my go-to doctor ever since. Francois is a very caring & gentle medical professional. He is very knowledgeable, but does not complicate the visit by any medical jargon & is very straight & to the point in many cases. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a professional & clean facility for family & singles alike."
"My son and I are so happy with Dr. Mazza-Whelan. She is an absolute professional and a dream to visit! Her office is great, all the staff are so nice. And the waiting room has plenty of magazines and toys and a TV to keep the kids entertained. Everyone is so great with kids. My son is never exactly *happy* to go to the doctor, but he is never scared or upset in the office. Her office is part of a larger chain of physicians, but I honestly do not get any corporate vibes off of her practice. Dr. Mazza-Whelan herself is wonderful with kids. Whenever she examines my son, he never puts up a fuss or fight. He's never once cried or been scared. She has a very calming effect upon him. At other doctor's offices, he's cried when having his blood drawn. But Dr. Mazza-Whelan knows how upsetting this is for him, so she draws the blood herself instead of asking a nurse to do it. This has really helped to calm my son down. She listens to both his concerns and my concerns, and she's never led us astray in any treatments. She also gives out lots of free samples for the different drugs (especially nasal sprays) my son needs to help lower the costs for his medications. I highly recommend Dr. Mazza-Whelan, especially for younger kids!"
"Recently I had to switch doctors as I was not happy with my doctor as I had been ill for several months and they had no solution and could not come up with a proper diagnosis. I came across Doctor Viviers at Niagara on the Lake family health and him and the entire staff were truly a blessing. Because of them I am finally better because they were thorough and continued to follow up with me until a proper diagnosis was made. Unlike many other doctors he is not just out to make a buck, I feel he does truly care about his patients. Doctor Viviers is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable and you can trust he has your best interest in mind. I can again trust a Doctor thanks to Doctor Viviers and the rest of the staff at Niagara on the lake. Not only do you get the great service of Doctor Viviers there are 9 other physicians on staff who cover for each other and they all seem to duplicate the efforts of Doctor Viviers. I would recommend Doctor Viviers and the entire Niagara on the lake practice to other family members and friends. Your health is an important part of your life and I think its important to find a practice that believes this as well and I have found this in Niagara on the lake."
"This practice has it all! From mental health to regular family physicians, to pharmacists, all my well-being needs can met in one place. It is conveniently located on Niagara Stone Road. And check out the website for ideas on healthy eating advice, as well as links to pages on how to live healthy."
"Dr. Viviers is one of the kindest doctors I have seen in a long time. I recently contracted mono, which at the time I had no idea what was wrong with me, but with in minutes he knew what was ailing me. I was so happy to find such a knowledgeable doctor not only in general, but right in my own backyard. Thanks again Dr. Vivers I owe you one."
"Dr. Viviers and Associates are the best in the area. The receoptionists were kind and easy to talk to, the wait was one of the shortest I've had, and the doctor we direct and to the point without using too much medical jargon. I would recommend them a your family doctor and even go as far as to change doctors to this office. Two thumbs up!"
"The Family Health Team at Niagra-on-the-Lake has been a blessing to our family for the past four years. We are particularly indebted to Dr. Francios Viviers, who has become our family's physician. We are grateful for the attentiveness given to our family by the FHT, and for their compassion and professionalism. Dr. Viviers has dedicated himself to his patients, and we have become very confident in his skills and capabilities when treating our family. He is particularly compassionate and bears a gentle bedside manner, which is so appreciated, yet seldom seen in today's busy times. The staff of the FHT is professional, courteous and also very caring. They are clearly well-trained, yet they bring a quality of personal, individual care to the patient in a stressful situation. We are very grateful to Dr. Viviers and his team. "
"I had a great experience with Dr. Viviers office. The office was very clean and willing to help me with all my medical needs. They are great one on one person facility and they truly cared to help me with all my needs. I would recommend Dr. Viviers office to all."
"Doctor Francois Viviers's office was impeccable. I used to have strokes that would occur within days or months. I was always afraid when one would occur and if it would happen when no one was around. Sometimes I thought I could die within that week because my stress would get so high. Luckily someone recommended me to Doctor Vivier. He was able to give me the name of someone who would show me the right foods to eat to prevent another stroke from happening in the near future as well as lay out all the risk factors for me. Some of which I knew, but most that I had never even dreamed possible. He showed me how to also add multiple applications into my phone that can give me basic information or help. If you have a family member or are in need of someone ASAP then I suggest you call this man! He was so kind and helpful."
"I had a appointment with Dr. Francois Viviers at Niagara-on-the-Lake Family Health Team. Dr. Francois Viviers was extremely friendly and open minded to my concerns were and what I had to say. He was very helpful, completed everything I needed with absolutely no problems at all was very respectful. I can't wait until our next appointment and I've been recommending him to everybody. So if you're on the edge about your Dr. or just dont feel comfortable. Talk to Dr. Francois Viviers."
"After the birth of my third child, my body seemed to have a harder time bouncing back. When I finally decided on liposuction for my "muffin top", I visited a few different practices in the area. Dr. Richards and the staff at Cosmetic Surgery Associates, PA made me feel welcome and comfortable from the moment I walked through the door. Dr. Richards was both knowledgeable and understanding. He made me feel at ease and confident in this decision. As for the procedure, it went better than I could have ever hoped. There are no scars that I can see, and my sides and back are slimmer and more attractive than ever! I feel like a new woman, and it's all thanks to this amazing doctor! "
"Dr Richards was a joy to have as a practitioner. From the start, he was calm and helpful while listening to my needs. I can't express how pleased I am with the whole process and how it went. The surgery was very successful and I was left with little swelling and recovery was a breeze. He was very communicative and allowed me to ask as many questions as I needed in order to feel comfortable. His expertise was comfort enough at first, but as I got to know him as a person I felt so much better when the surgery came around. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a plastic surgeon."
"It's nice to know there are people out there you can still rely on. I have a very busy work schedule and only had a small window to come in. I told them I was really strapped for time and they were still able to fit me in. Dr. Whelan took the time to get to know me on a personal level. Then explained everything to me clearly, laid out the steps that I needed to take, and answered all my questions. It's nice to know that I am more then just another patient to Dr. Whelan. "
"Franklin Richards is an amazing doctor that I have never had any problems with whatsoever. He is very trustworthy, and doesn't overcharge you for his practices like many other doctors. He is very caring and understanding when it comes to personal problems. He is by far the best cosmetic doctor I have ever had, and I would never choose another doctor over him. "
"Dr. Richards is fantastic. He was both pleasant and very professional. I felt like he truly listened to what I wanted as well as any questions and concerns I had. Admittedly, I was quite nervice for the procedure but Dr. Richards team made the extra effort to make me feel comfortable and calm. All and all, if I ever need or want cosmetic surgery again, I will definitely be going back to Dr. Richards. "
"Dr. Franklin Richards recently performed liposuction surgery on me. I am very satisfied with the results of my surgery and the services he provided. You can barely see the small incisions that were made and can definitely see the slimming results! I would highly recommend Dr. Richards and his entire staff. I felt very well taken care of during my consultation, procedure and follow-ups."
"When I visited doctor Franklin, he was nothing but helpful and patient with me when we were picking out the options for my surgery. I would recommend him to anyone! My recovery time afterwards was shorter than ever, and if I ever need more procedures I would come back to him in a heartbeat."
"I have been a client of Dr. Richards for many years and have always had very good results from his work. What has and continues to attract me most to Dr. Richards is his level of professionalism and the customer service provided by his office. My most recent surgery was about 3 months ago and like always the results were immaculate. I will continue to use Dr. Richards and recommend him to anyone!"
"Went to Dr Richards office for a consultation and information on breast implant surgery. Was very nervous and unsure but within minutes the staff made me feel right at home and at ease. Dr Richards was great as he explained the procedure to me, answering all my question and addressing all of my concerns. Long story short I had my breast surgery and couldn't be more pleased ! Dr Richard did an outstanding job ! I was worried my breasts would look unnatural but they don't and actually it looks like I was born with " them " :) Thank you Dr Richards !!"
"Finding the right doctor is a very difficult process because not only do you need someone who does good work but you also need someone who you feel comfortable with. Dr. Richards is amazing! He made me feel 100% comfortable with him doing the procedure. He was very upfront and explain everything to me so that I could understand what was going to happen. I also appreciated the fact that he gave me his honest opinion so that I would not end up having something done that would leave me looking a mess. After having everything done I'm 200% satisfied with the results and I will never go to another doctor. "
"Oh she is just the best doctor I have ever met. so friendly and smart and very kind. explains a lot on the condition you have and further provides useful information and stuff that I can do at home to make sure that I fell comfortable. I definantly will go back to her. She answered any question I had and was more than willing to accommodate. further she actually cares about her patients and always on time. which is really good. "
"Dr. Georgina Barnardo at the Lakeside Medical Clinic has been my doctor for three years now. I have constantly been impressed with her professionalism, but also her attention to detail and her ability to remember small details about my life that make everything feel personalized. She takes time to listen to my concerns and never makes me feel as though they are unwarranted. Often, she gives me extra health tips throughout my visit, usually tips I would have never otherwise thought about! She usually responds to my calls within the hour and doesn't ever seem to be in a hurry or that my call isn't worth her time. I have been very pleased with Dr. Barnardo and would recommend her to anyone. "
"I had acquired this horrible cough that lasted over a month. I had tried all of the OTC medicine that was available. I thought my cough was getting better until one night when I couldn't breathe well. I saw an ad for Lakeside Medical Clinic the day before and saw that they accepted walk-in's. I rushed over there and received a fast response to my problem. Doctor Barnardo was assigned to me and quickly did the required tests to diagnose my condition. Dr. Barnardo was very polite and skilled at what she was doing. Let's just say that I stopped coughing and have never felt better!"
"Dr. Mazza-Whelan is an absolutely wonderful doctor. I had come in for some sudden headaches which would not go away for several days; as soon as the nurse came to check my vitals and submitted the chart to the doc, she came in right away and asked me more details about my headache. The doctor spent a great deal of time with me and was very courteous even when a nurse interrupted. my problem was resolved when the doc provided me some light counseling; she gave me a referral to see a neurologist if I feel the same pains again. I really admire her holistic approach and that she didn't just prescribe me a medication. Thank you doc!"
"I was extremely satisfied after I was treated by Dr. Georgiana Barnardo at the Lakeside Medical Clinic. She was very thorough and understood my problems. She was immediately able to understand what I was saying and form a hypothesis. She seems to be very well educated in her field. She ran a test and found that she had been correct all along, and she wrote me a prescription. I am already feeling better! "
"Dr. Barnardo is wonderful and a true professional! The entire office staff is pure class and from the moment you walk into the office you feel like you are at home. It is very clean and welcoming and makes you feel like you made the right decision. The equipment is completely state of the art and I have never had an issue with something not working properly. She so is friendly and goes out of her way to make you feel like you are the center of attention. I sometimes have trouble asking the right questions but Dr. Barnardo has no problem talking with me about my ailment and making sure I have a full understanding of what is going on and what the next steps are. She will wait all day and make sure that we are ready to move forward. She makes me feel like I am a member of her own family."
"When I found out I needed surgery, it made me very nervous. I didn't like the idea of sitting in a room with a bunch of strangers in masks asking me questions about my personal health. Doctor Barnardo and his staff were very warm and friendly, not to mention respectful of my situation. I wasn't overwhelmed with paperwork, or waiting for hours just to sit in a cold room while various people came in and out asking questions and then leaving. One nurse talked me through everything they were doing and helped me relax and feel comfortable the whole time."
"I am new to the area so I have been looking for a new doctor. I got several recommendations to try Dr. Barnardo at Lakeside Medical Clinic. That was a great suggestion! Dr. Barnardo is very smart. He did not rush me through my visit. He answered all my questions. His staff was very friendly. The office was clean. I spent less than 5 minutes waiting for my appointment. Even my wife liked the doctor and she really does not like doctors! I will be going to this office from now on."
"Lakeside Medical Clinic has given me the best experience from beginning to end and continues to only impress me. As a full family practice they have covered everything from times when I've felt under the weather at a moments notice to my regular yearly health visits. Their website is one of the best and easy to navigate. I can make appointments online, or call in and be helped by one of their helpful staff. Dr Georgina Barnardo is my doctor and I can only say she is incredible. She promptly sees me when I get there for my appointment and calmly listens to anything I have to say, whether its my yearly check up or a special visit when I'm feeling sick. There is no sense of rush even though there are always other patients to see and she is very good at answering any amount of questions I have bout my health or results. She is the model doctor we all wish for when we walk into a doctors office, she is personable while being professional and her staff is kind as well. Dr. Barnardo is someone I would highy reccommend to all my friends and family because I know that whether they have an emergency, need ob-gyn visit or other common medical needs the doctor will take care of them in her practice. Im confident of that and hopefully you get to experience the calm I do when visiting her office."
"Dr Ayling is a caring and knowledgeable doctor. I had visited his office for an annual check-up two weeks ago. When I setup the appointment, the front desk was very kind and took all the information needed including insurance details and they gave me a favorable time-slot. When I arrived at Dr. Ayling's office, I was surpised at the clean office and the friendliness of the staff. The appointment was prompt and Dr. Ayling greeted me and reviewed each point on my annual check-up patiently and answered all my questions. I would recommend Dr. Ayling and his group to anyone. Keep up the good work!"
"My family and I have been going to Westcoast for a few years now. So far our experience has been exceptional. WHen our 4 year old son came down with the Flu Dr. Ayling happened to be the Doctor on call that night. Since it was after hours we thought we would have to go to the hospital, but Dr. Ayling made himself available to help our son out. We are greatful to have a family practice that cares about its community and patients. We definatly are greatful for not having to spend the night in the E.R. Thanks again Dr. Ayling and the rest of the staff at Westcoast! "
"I am writing this review to document a very pleasant experience. Normally going to see a doctor is not something that we look forward to. But if you do find yourself needing a good doctor, I would definitely recommend Dr Grant Ayling of the west coast family practice. Together with the other four doctors, you feel confident and you are treated with respect. Dr. Grant Ayling was friendly and very reassuring. I felt comfortable from the moment he greeted me with a warm smile and a caring face. I would definitely recommend Dr Grant Ayling."
"I went to Dr. Grant Ayling today for the first time. I had just moved to the area and a friend mentioned him and I decided to give it a chance. I was so surprised how nice they are there. He was very attentive when I described my symptoms. And I would recommend people to see Dr Grant Ayling before anyone else. "
"Grant Ayling was a fabulous doctors who treated me and my family with a happy, refreshing attitude. Dr. Ayling made sure my kids felt safe and comfortable during the entire visit, but he made it super speedy and I was happy to not be waiting for a long time. Dr. Ayling is a doctor I do not dread going to see!"
"I visited Dr Mazza-Whelan's office for advice on nutrition. I'd heard she and her staff we friendly and very knowledgeable in regards to their services. Dr Mazza-Whelan was extremely patient with my questions, and made me feel comfortable. Her answers were clear and precise, and I know I can trust her for my family and my future visits."
"I went to Dr Grants practice because i was experiencing chest pains. I was extremely pleased with how quickly i was able to see the Doctor. The practice while located on third floor was easy to find. Dr Grant was very polite and gentle, he was prompt and quick with his diagnosis. As it turns out i was suffering from a minor condition, none the less the doctor set me at ease. I would recommend the Doctors practice to my friends and family. "
"Dr. Ayling is a friendly, personable M.D. with a big smile and warm disposition. He makes going to the doctor's office a joy. He never keeps me waiting and really takes an interest in my health. Dr. Ayling likes to talk with his patients and really listens to my responses. His diagnoses are always on target. Highly recommended."
"I just moved to the Vancouver area, and I was worried about finding a primary physician. West Coast Family Practice Centre made me feel right at home in an unfamiliar town! After filling out the usual background paperwork, and the vital checks, I met Dr. Ayling. He was great, took time to answer all my questions, and I never felt rushed. He has a very calming "bedside manner." I would be happy to recommend Dr. Ayling or any of the other physicians at Westcoast Family Practice Centre!"
"I liked that I was able to see Dr. Ayling the same day. It's comforting to be seen by your own doctor the day you need them. I was having pain in my stomach and wasn't sure what to do. Dr. Ayling was so good with me and I felt that he was really listening to me. He never jumped in to try to talk over me - I hate that. The examination was thorough but quick. Then he had several ideas on how I could feel better. I really appreciated that he did not just tell me it would just go away or just give me a pill. We discussed the method I felt most comfortable with and then he explained what to do if that wasn't enough. He was great and told me what to do if I needed more urgent help during off-clinic hours. When I left Dr. Ayling's clinic, I felt relieved and like I had a plan. Thank you so much Dr. Ayling! "
"I was searching endlessly for a professional and friendly plastic surgeon in order to get a breast lift. I knew the procedure is something to be taken lightly, especially since the muscle surround your breast is coming to be cut into. But Dr. Silverman put my mind at ease. He explained to me the different options in terms of an incision (lollipop, anchor, or areolar) and what he felt would best suit me. Dr. Silverman also provided me information on what to do pre and post surgery, and never once along the way did I feel force to do something I did not want to do. He also does procedures concerning the face and body, so after my breast lift, I would love to go back to him and get the rest of my body done. "
"Dr. Silverman and his staff were very friendly and professional through my transformation process. They took their time to explain, in detail what I would expect during each step of the procedure, including pre and post treatment. I am very satisfied with the outcome of Dr. Silvermans work and with my overall experience with the office visits. "
"I have been considering breast implants for the last six months. One day I finally decided to make the call to Dr. Howard Silverman. He scheduled a one on one consultation for me the next day and sure enough I was ready to get started. Dr. Howard Silverman personal consultation gave me the courage to proceed to the next step. Throughout the whole ordeal Dr. Howard Silverman and his staff treated me with privacy, respect and care I needed and deserved. I am very satisfied with my new breast. I carry a few of his cards with me at all times and when my girlfriends compliment my breast I hand them a card. That is how satisfied I am with my new and improved breast."
"From the start of our consultation, Dr Silverman was extremely helpful and informative, providing me with credentials and expert advice. There are an array of services that he provides so that you don't have to go to multiple doctors. I know I feel a lot more comfortable having my breasts augmented by the same doctor who did great on my laser hair removal. "
"What more can I say, I love Dr. Silverman! He gave me my confidence back and I couldn't be more grateful for this talented and kind doctor! After losing a significant amount of weight, my breasts became saggy and lifeless. I kept thinking about cosmetic surgery but the process was so overwhelming. I wanted a doctor who was exceptionally talented but also someone who would really listen to me. It wasn't until I heard a glowing review of Dr. Silverman from a coworker that I knew that this was the time to seize my opportunity. From the moment I walked into his office, all the way to the follow-up sessions after my breast lift, I felt at ease. Dr. Silverman's credentials are impeccable (he even has hospital privileges at top hospitals) and getting to see photos of his work really eased my mind. He was extremely honest with me about what I could expect from the surgery and how long the recovery time would be. This was the best decision I have ever maid for myself. If you're thinking about cosmetic surgery and you want a talented and caring doctor, you owe it to yourself to look into Dr. Silverman. I hope this review helped! "
"I am pleased to recommend Dr. Howard Silverman, following my successful breast enhancement surgery he performed on me. While I was somewhat nervous at the outset, Dr. Silverman provided me all the information I needed to make an informed decision to have the surgery. He explained all the procedures thoroughly beforehand, and did the surgery exactly as I requested. He continued with follow-up after the surgery in a most professional manner. I am very happy with the results, and will use Dr. Silverman for any other plastic surgery I may decide to have in the future."
"Dr. Mazza-Whelan and the team at Hamilton Family Health Team are exceptional doctors. The office staff are always friendly and greets you as soon as you walk in the door. If you call and need a last minute appointment they will do their best to squeeze you in, and are very accommodating to all schedules. The practice is neat and organized, as wait times are rarely over 5 minutes. The nurses that start your appointment are top-of-the-line and skillful, and the doctors are incredibly professional. You do not feel rushed as Dr. Mazza-Whelan takes time to listen to your symptoms, and will converse with you regarding her thoughts (not talk "at" you). Dr. Mazza-Whelan will answer as many questions as I can come up with, so I leave the office feeling reassured and informed. If my doctor is booked up and I need an appointment, I have no hesitation to schedule with another doctor, as the communication and atmosphere at the clinic is so friendly I know the doctors will easily share information so that patients can transition between providers smoothly. All in all, this is the clinic I have trusted for years--not only for myself, but for my family."
"Dr. Silverman and his staff were nothing short of fantastic. From the moment I entered their office for my consultation appointment, I felt comfortable and at ease. I was a little hesitant to meet with a plastic surgeon regarding elective surgery, but I'm so glad I did. He answered all my questions in a profession manner and never once did I feel pressured into making a snap decision. I would recommend anyone considering elective plastic surgery to meet with Dr. Silverman before choosing a doctor."
"Dr. Silverman was a big help when I was making my decision about getting cosmetic surgery. He didn't push anything on me, he just laid out what the surgery entailed and what I could except of the outcome. He didn't sugarcoat the risks of surgery but Dr. Silverman was also very reassuring that the risks could be minimized. The outcome was even better than I had hoped and I am very happy with the results. I would highly recommend Dr. Silverman, he was professional, honest and very competent."
""Experience Matters" is how I would describe my results overall in completing a face lift through the office of Doctor Howard Silverman of Ottawa. I did a lot of reading and research in making my decision to take the risk of having a face lift. Once I decided that I would have the procedure done, I had to do a good deal more research in selecting a doctor and practice to perform my surgery. It is true that your results ARE only as good as the skill that the doctor has in performing the surgery itself. I carefully reviewed Dr. Silverman's qualifications and references, I read his patient referrals, spoke with past patients and looked at his before and after results. I also took into account the number of years he has been performing surgeries and the number of face lift procedures he has performed. After considering all this information, the decision for me to use Dr. Howard Silverman to perform my surgery was easy. I am very pleased with my results. The after care I received following the surgery was excellent and helped make my results the best they could be. "
"I took my son to Mediclinic when I suspected he broke his ankle because it was the closest available medical facility to my house. When I went, they quickly took x-rays, found a break, and got him set up in a cast. Although I'm not happy about my son's injury, the friendly, quick service made the ordeal less difficult. Dr. Kriegler and his nurse are great with kids- they offered stickers, candy, and toys in the waiting room. The facilities are small, but clean and comfortable, and I was told that they have the latest X-ray equipment. I'll certainly go back the next time anyone in my family has an emergency. "
"I have a been a long time patient at the Mediclinic in Saskatoon for over 10+ years. In all that time the staff at the medical office have always been exceptionally kind and competent in every area of medical procure they have performed. They have reasonable billing prices for the procedures and will work with you to pay off your bills if you are having money issues. My doctor, Johann Kriegler, has been my personal physician for the entire time and I would warmly recommend him to my friends and family and have in the past. Dr. Kriegler always listens to my questions and answers them in a way that doesn't lead to confusion or misdirection, and I love that about him. He is honest and forthright, making our doctor/patient relationship easy and communicative. I would give the medical office a 10/10 and Dr. Kriegler a 15/10 because he really is the kind of doctor that makes going to the doctor a pleasant experience. "
"Johann Kriegler is by far one of the best doctors that I've ever had. I have never been so comfortable paying a visit to a doctor in my life. Everything Dr. Johann does just seems right and natural. I definitely recommend Dr. Johann for anyone who is looking for a kind and caring doctor."
"I found Mediclinic to be the perfect fit for me. I work at a job that often does not allow me to take time off for non-emergency type situations. I needed to visit the doctor for a routine check-up. I was able to make an evening appointment. In fact, this clinic is open from 9:00am until 9:00pm. I was greeted by a courteous receptionist as soon as I walked in. After a brief wait in a pleasant waiting area, I was called back to meet the doctor. Dr. Kriegler was very friendly, and listened to all of my concerns before going through my examination. All of the lab work that was required, was performed on the premises. Mediclinic was a very positive experience for me. I highly recommend it."
"The practice in which Dr. Kriegler works in is wonderful. This practice focuses on patient care and keep hours that are convenient for patients. They are open late during the week and opened on weekends as well as holiday's. The practice also offers new digital x-ray at the facility, and a lab so you can get many of your needs taken care of at one place. The urgent care can see many of your ailment's keeping you from spending long hours at the emergency room. Dr. Kriegler is wonderful and has great bedside manner, which is important for many people. I would recommend this practice and Dr. Kriegler to any of my family and friends, or anyone who is looking for a great place."
"Not only a doctor but a friend! One may think that going to the doctor is a pain, and not something to look forward to, but with Dr. Kriegler I get wonderful service and she treats you like a friend, we can talk easily and openly. It is the most comfortable clinic environment I have seen in a while. Dr. Kriegler is very understanding and intelligent about my medical conditions and questions and just knows the best thing to do. When I call in when she is not available, she gets back to me ASAP, and I can also just expect the best from her. "
"Dr. Kriegler is a fantastic doctor - very caring, attentive, and detailed in his approach. He never fails to truly listen to what you have to say about your symptoms, unlike other doctors who tend to railroad you over a bit and assume they already know what the issue is before even walking in the door. We have had a great experience overall with this office, even when my son needed urgent care for a broken arm. They got the x-ray done promptly and tried to make him as comfortable as possible. We would highly recommend Dr Kriegler and his personal approach! "
"Dr. Angela Mazza-Whelan is a life saver. I just recently moved into a new neighborhood and my daughter came over a cold so we did a quick search on the internet and found Hamilton Family Health Team and were referred to Dr. Whelan. Not only did Dr. Whelan diagnose the problem, she also helped see to it that my little girl was going to get better. We checked in once a week and was always greeted with a smile. I look forward to seeing my two other sons' in the good hands of Dr. Whelan. Her professional atmosphere I would call comforting to all parents to know that she takes the job seriously. "
"Several months ago I was in search of a Doctor to tell me why I had several spots on my skin. I was recommended to Doctor Johann Kriegler by a friend. I made a Doctor's appointment to see Dr. Kriegler on the next available date that I could be seen. My visit to his office was very cordial. He showed compassion to me by being engage through the entire visit. He is a professional and is excellent at his job. He recommended a treatment for my spots and over the period time I applied what He recommended and whatever was trying to takeover my skin went away. I recommend you visit Mediclinic Family Medicine and Urgent Care,101-3333-8th Street East,Saskatoon, Sask.S7H 4K1. "
"The office of Johann Kriegler has always been quick to help. The office staff are always quick and friendly. Johann listens to your questions, and explains everything in simple terms, with out making you feel like you are being a bother."
"Dr. Kriegler seems provides her patients with the same compassion and understanding that she would provide her own family members with. Her educational background and long years of experience are totally impressive. She always makes me feel that I am her top priority and is extremely compassionate and non-judgemental. In my past, I've had doctors who made me feel either like a number, or like an idiot, or both, but not Dr. Kriegler. She is a very good listener and always takes the time to answer my questions. While sometimes, I do have to wait a little bit longer than I'd like, my previous experience as her patient always makes it more acceptable to me than it has been with other doctors because I know how thorough she is and how she takes the time to be certain that any issue I might have will be addressed. "
"Dr. John Hasell is a very great doctor to go to. He is very knowledgeable and does excellent work. This is something that he has been doing for over 15 years and I completely trust him to do his best work and help me feel better about some parts on my body. I have no problem going to him and asking for help. Totally worth the money to get someone as experienced and skilled as Dr. John Hasell!"
"I went to Dr. Hasell's office three months ago because a friend recommended him to me. I have always had trouble with the way my nose looks and it had started to affect my breathing. After a brief consultation I was told what to expect and I set up the procedure. The whole process was simple and my surgery was successful. I now look much better than before and I can breathe just fine. I would recommend him to anyone seeking plastic surgery."
"My experience with Dr. Hasell and his staff was beyond what you normally get at other offices. I had previously used a different plastic surgeon for other procedures I had done, but based on recommendations from friends I chose Dr. Hassell for my breast augmentation. I was a little seeing a new doctor, but Dr. Hasell put me at ease on my first consultation. When it came time for my procedure the whole staff were very helpful and professional, and the I was very glad to have chosen Dr. Hasell. My procedure went flawlessly, and I could not have expected better results. A big thanks to Dr. Hasell, as well as Kelly Ann, Peggy, and Dawn, for making my surgery an enjoyable experience. Mary Looper"
"Dr Hasell was caring and compassionate. He took plenty of time to explain my procedure and answered all of the questions I had. His staff was also friendly and professional. I would recommend this Dr. "
"Before I visited Dr. John Hasell, I was painfully aware of the size and shape of my nose. I had been teased incessantly as a child about it, and my high school years were a nightmare of constant harrassment. Consequently, I was timid, insecure and ashamed of my looks. Dr. Hasell was able to restore my confidence and dignity, and literally changed my life. I am now in college, and enjoying something I never had before--friendship, respect and fun! Thank you Dr. Hasell!"
"Dr. Hasell and his staff could not have been friendlier. I found his practice through his website and, sure enough, everyone introduced there was who I interacted with. I was first greeted by his receptionist, a very helpful woman (she answered a few questions I had, I was skeptical of the office when I first came). I was led back to his office for a short consultation, and after almost no wait, I was speaking to the doctor himself. He was friendly and informative. He did not make me feel judged or uncomfortable about what I was looking for. I do not regret that consultation, and scheduled a surgery shortly after!"
"I saw Dr. Hasell last fall when he helped me with the repair of some skin on my hand that had been burned due to an accident at work. He was very thorough in answering questions proactively during the initial consultations, and also afterward about post-op care and so forth. I feel he takes his the quality of his work very seriously and therefore I trusted him to do a great job, and he did!"
"Dr. Angela Mazza-Whelan is a wonderful family doctor and would be an asset to any family in the Ontario area. Dr. Mazza-Whelan is great with children and parents alike. She is knowledgeable about all kinds of sicknesses and good at communicating with kids about their symptoms. She is also extremely helpful and good at making sure that the kids and parents understand their illnesses and treatments. Plus, like any good parent would know, waiting in a doctor's office with a sick kid is no fun for anyone. Dr. Mazza-Whelan is always very punctual and my family has never had to wait a long time for her appointments. "
"John Hasell five star review. I went in to see DR John Hasell, I have never seen him befor today and how impressed was I when I walked in to his office. I have heard good things about DR John Hasell and also have heard that he sees people for cosmetic surgery, we wont go in to detail on what I had to see DR John Hasell for but what a great doctor to see. The staff was very friendly and helpful, I got right in to see the doctor even being a new patient there, to my amazement he was able to answer all of my questions he did not rush me out the door to get the next paying patient in there, he treated me like I was the only one that he was going to see that day even though he had a lobby full of patients. I left knowing all the answers to my questions and was very satisfied."
"Dr. Hassell has been an amazing help to me, he is an extremely well versed doctor whom I would recommend to all of my friends and family! After being passed from doctor to doctor, only Dr. Hassell was able to relieve my constant sinus symptoms. What I enjoy most about him is his holistic approach, his solutions aren't simply prescribing pills, unlike other doctors I have experienced in the past, he searches for the natural, healthy way to diagnose and treat. He is very friendly, kind, and patient, he took the time to listen to me and answered all of my questions knowledgeably. Thank you, Dr. Hassell!"
"Dr. Hasell is a fantastic physician. I went in for a relatively routine procedure and was still very nervous. However, both he and his staff were able to explain to me exactly what they were going to do and there was no need to worry. He and his staff are also very personable, and it is evident that they are truly passionate about their jobs. It was the most comforted I've ever felt at the doctor's office, and the procedure went smoothly. I highly recommend him to anyone needing cosmetic surgery."
"Dr. Keller is great. He helped me through the process and treated me as kind as possible. He was easy to talk to and didn't make me feel nervous. Dr. Keller is an understanding, gentle doctor who will guide you through the procedures with ease. He does a great job and always makes sure you are okay in follow-up appointments."
"John Keller is well-like by many, and has an extraordinary amount of skill. Dr. Keller uses more natural approaches to surgery, with amazing results. With reasonable prices and a kind, caring environment, this is simply the best clinic for cosmetic surgery of any kind. Dr. Keller is an experienced and successful individual. "

Dr John Keller is board certified and experienced in his field. He is available for appropriate consultations for your cosmetic surgical needs."
"I could not be happier with my visit to The Baywood Clinic. Years of fear kept me from even thinking about getting Botox done, but as the lines in my face became deeper, I knew it was a matter of saving my self-esteem. My consultation with Dr. John Keller really put me at ease; what a wonderful and patient professional! Even though he is certified as an Advanced Botox Injector, he was very honest about the procedure and my concerns; he warned me that pain really does vary from one person to the next and was up front about the side-effects that may (but rarely do) occur. I really appreciated this and in the end, asked him to do my treatments. I am so grateful to Dr. Keller; everything turned out beautifully and I am scheduled for another session in 7 months!"
"I had been considering botox treatment for a while. A friend recommended Dr. Keller at The Baywood Clinic and I couldn't be happier with my experience! Dr. Keller and the staff were incredibly helpful, courteous and professional. The results were fantastic and the price can't be beat. I would highly recommend Dr. Keller for regular treatments, or just for a special occasion."
"I had been suffering from wrinkles and sag lines on my face for a few years and have been self conscious about it since i got them. Finally, I had decided to see a doctor. I was referred to Dr. John Keller at Baywood Clinic by a friend and decided to check him out myself. When I went to see him the extremely friendly receptionist helped me fill out my paperwork and I was in the office with the doctor within 10 minutes. Dr. Keller listened to everything I had said with true interest. He seemed to really care about everything i had to say. We discussed my options and ended up choosing skin filler and botox. I went back 2 weeks later and had both operations done at the same time. My face looked exactly as it did when I was in my twenties. Dr. Keller did an unbelievable job and I recommend him to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery."
"Dr. Lurie is an exceptional physician with a successful practice. He has always been very very accommodating with his schedule whenever I need to visit with him on short notice. Dr. Lurie and his staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable with years of experience and offer good advice regarding my health. His office is warm and inviting unlike some doctor offices which helps to put me at ease the second I walk in the door. I know myself and my family are in good hands with Dr. Lurie. "
"My experience with Dr. John Keller was unmatched!! From the time that I entered the office until my treatment was complete, I received the most amazing customer service. Although this was my first experience, Dr. Keller as well as his staff made me feel very comfortable about my procedure, and his medical expertise was enlightening. When you leave his office you will not be nervous if you were before, and you will understand everything that will happen during your procedure. I highly recommend him after this experience."
"I came to Dr. Keller at the Baywood clinic for laser hair removal on my body. As I am Asian, my underarms and other parts of my body look terrible with normal hair growth. I was extremely embarrassed by my dark underarms and was shamed to wear tank tops when I was visited my family back in Thailand as their is such pressure to maintain flawless skin. I decided it was time to remove my underarm hair forever as I had a wedding back in Thailand coming up and I wanted to feel confident in the photos. Having reviewed Dr. Keller's credentials and the fact he is an Examiner for the American Board of Laser medicine, I felt at ease, even if this is just a minor procedure. I can say that during all treatments he was extremely professional, timely and the cost was competitive for a highly trained doctor. The hair removal went as planned and I am excited for my upcoming wedding now that I have even more confidence. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Keller to friends and family and want to thank everyone at the Baywood Clinic for their excellent service and professionalism."
"Dr. Joseph Longnecker is a wonderful physician. He takes the time to explain any concern, that I may have, thoroughly. He is a gentle, kind and caring doctor. I would recommend him highly to anyone. I have taken my children to see him as well. He makes jokes and plays with them to keep their attention off of the examination. If you are looking for a doctor that has a heart and wonderful bedside manner, this is the doctor for you. "
"I've looked all across California for a good family practice that cares for the individual. My family and I have had previous problems with other facilities in the past. A friend recommended Dr. Longnecker, I took my youngest in for a routine checkup and the service and care was expenential. I've recommended to my friends and there experiances seem very much like mine professional, quick, and with great care."
"I cannot say enough about Dr. Longnecker and his staff! We were in the area visiting my in laws when our daughter came down with what we thought was a cold. After OTC medicines didn't help we found Dr. Longnecker through our insurance website. They not only got us in immediately, but once we arrived we weren't left in the waiting room because we were walk ins. The staff was very courteous and easily put my daughter and I at ease. Dr. Longnecker was quick to come in, spent some time questioning what had been going on, and actually included my daughter in the convo. He prescribed some medicines and even gave us trials so I was able to take my sick girl home right away. Once I got back out front his staff had actually found a pharmacy near my in laws and called in the prescription for me! So helpful when you've got a sick child. Although we don't live in the area, I so thankful to know if the need ever arises again that Dr. Longnecker is available!"
"Both my daughter and I see Dr. Longnecker and I have never had a bad experience with him. After you sign in the wait time is rarely over 15 minutes, he is polite, clear speaking, and takes the time to explain everything to me. When my daughter had to go to the hospital Dr. Longnecker was the quarterback of the entire experience. He made sure that the hospital was ready for her admittance and oversaw every step taken. Additionally, I love that he is affiliated with St. Jude, it is exactly where I wanted my daughter to go. (OR if it needs to me more generic...) Dr. Longnecker is a great doctor who has gone the extra mile to not only treat my family and myself when we are sick but make sure we understand what is wrong and are up to date on preventative care. The office staff is friendly and organized. There are never appointment errors or long wait times. I completely trust my family to be in his care. 5 Stars."
"Dr. Joseph Longnecker is a wonderful physician. His office is very warm and inviting, alleviating any anxiety that some may endure when going visiting the dotor. Dr. Longnecker is very personable and truly cares about each and every patient. My family has been seeing him for years. He is great with the kids and they absolutley adore him."
"Dr. Longnecker is my favorite doctor! His "bedside manner" is unparalleled, making me feel relaxed even in the sickest of states. He is efficient but not cold, which is perfect for me. He comes into the examination room, immediately performs the necessary tests and asks the necessary questions, and, once this is all said and done, he asks me about my family/job/etc. It's refreshing to have a doctor feel like he cares about you, especially in this day and age of managed care making doctors see more and more patients. I highly recommend going to see him for a pleasant experience!"
"during a recent illness i went to st. jude medical center and saw dr joseph longnecker. now nost doctervisits are more of a burden and are not enjoyable, however the care that was provided at dr joseph longneckers office was well above average. the nurses were very polite, and the doctor himself was very knowledgeable. his bedside manner was very good, and he took the time to answer all my questions. "
"I just wanted to say that Dr.Joseph Longnecker is one of the best doctors I have ever seen. I live in Fullerton, California and my child was very sick. I took him to many doctors and none of them knew the problem. I was searching for some doctors near me when I saw his name. I called him and he told me he would see my child right away. He is affiliated with St Jude Medical Center which is in Fullerton, California. He checked my child for about ten minutes and instantly knew what was wrong with him. He gave me a prescription for some medicine and another appointment so he could check up on my child again. He was very helpful and did not give me an appointment that was months away. I would recommend Dr.Joseph Longnecker to everyone I know. He is truly a very good doctor."
"Dr. Aboolian is a very professional and high quality plastic surgeon. His website is incredibly professional looking and instantly made me feel more comfortable with him. He has performed surgery for numerous contestants from the TV shows "The Biggest Loser" and "Extreme Makeover." Dr. Aboolian has also been named Super Doctor by his colleagues in Southern California. His office offers a number of different procedures for a diverse population. So, whatever you're interested in having done, Dr. Aboolian's office can likely do. He also offers a number of ways to pay for his services, including financing plans for patients. "
"Dr. Lurie was really great! I was called back to see him on time, and he didn't keep me waiting. His entire team is punctial and professional. His receptionists are helpful and courteous, and his nurses are knowledgeable and efficient. He's a thorough, compotent doctor with a great personality. I'd recommend him to any of my friends or family without thinking twice!"
"I went to The Doctors Office for the first time last week, and I was very pleased with the way my husband and I were treated, from the moment we stepped into the reception area all the way through the visit. We saw Dr. Karima Ali, and she was very patient with us. She explained that some additional tests were needed but she had someone verify that our insurance would cover them before we left. We will definitely continue to see her in the future."
"The doctors office provides excellent service with highly qualified physicians who are coherent when expressing what their patients should do for their well being."
"Dr. Karima Ali's in my opinion is one of the finest doctors in this professional. Her courteous, comprehensive and attentive approach to my medical needs have by far superceded the recommendation and the referral that I received from my colleague. Prior to my first visit with Dr. Ali I was a little dismayed in my success at finding a medical practitioner that came with an authentic and geniune bedside manner as well. Needless to say that I have found that and more in Dr. Ali. Not only is the Dr. one of the top professionals in this field,the innovative technology and exceptional customer service is par none. I highly recommend Dr. Ali for anyone in need of this specific medical support."
"I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Ali.I went to see her for my annual checkup. She is very smart and knows what she is talking about.Dr.Ali is also very patient, interested to hear you out and doesn't rush you just to get to her next appointment like most other doctors do. I'm for sure going back to see Dr.Ali"
"I went to the doctor today and saw Dr. Karima Ali.The office was busy,many people waiting.My wait time was minimal,no sooner that I signed in,they were calling my name.The doctor smiled when he talked and was friendly.He complemented on my blouse that I was wearing.When I told the doctor my problem,he was very concerned and he asked many questions and covered all the bases.And turns out that his diagnosis was correct.The medicine I took cured my problem.This is the best complete experience that I have ever had with a doctor.I will keep him as my regular doctor."
"My experience with Dr. Ali can only be marked as a positive one. The atmosphere and staff were very inviting and caring and it only reflected more on Dr. Ali. The care and concern which was felt by her was very appreciated and made me feel like she did care about my well being and was generally concerned. I felt more like a patient and not just a medical chart with a concern. I will be keeping Dr. Ali and I encourage anyone else looking for a doctor to look her up. "
"Dr. Karima Ali is a kind, accommodating physician who considers the needs of her patients as her top priority. I remember that when I first visited her, I instantly felt important and special in her eyes despite the numerous patients left in the waiting room. I have visited her for many years. She frequently asks after my family even if they do not have an appointment scheduled for that day. Dr. Ali also is attentive even when I am not in the office. She made sure that my medications were not contraindicated when my pharmacist called to consult with her. She refers me to specialists whenever she feels it is completely necessary and only after a thorough work-up was completed. She also takes my fear of advanced testing such as CAT scans carefully into consideration and gives me short trials of prescription medication instead to treat my symptoms. I consider her a close family friend after all these years and I can tell that she also knows me well and appreciates my loyalty to her."
"Dr. Karima Ali has been our family physician for 14 years now and we have been nothing but extremely satisfied! Unlike other doctors, Dr. Ali takes his time to truly get to know our family and children, and in doing so, has been able to gain our trust in him and his diagnosis'. From the simple flu, which my four children get often, to broken bones and blood work, my family has never had one single complaint. When you enter the office, the staff is very friendly and willing to accommodate you in any way necessary while you wait. They have a plethora of magazines, books, and children toys to keep everyone busy. As a parent, I am thankful for a doctor like Dr. Ali and as a patient myself, I have never had one complaint. Keep up the good work doctor and we'll see you in 6 months for our check ups!"
"Dr. Ali is my favorite doctor of all time. I had felt that I'd never get the care that I wanted or felt I deserved until I went to her. She listens very carefully and actually takes all of your symptoms and/or concerns into consideration instead of just focusing on one thing and not treating the other conditions or looking into other possibilities. It's refreshing to find a medical professional who actually cares. Finally, someone who truly knows what health CARE is. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for more personalized attention."
"Karima Ali is an excellent doctor. I went to take my children there - and generally, my children are afraid of doctors. Not only was Karima Ali very knowledgeable, she was also very friendly. My children did not cry or whine at all when being treated by Karima. Usually, my children can prove to be quite the handful when going to the doctor's office. Karima was friendly and accommodating, using great technique when interacting with children. However, when she interacted with me, she was very professional and put me at ease. I have been to other family doctors before, and none compare to Karima. I have been displeased with their general negative attitude towards my children, but Karima showed patience and compassion - traits necessary for a family doctor. She was the best family doctor I have had, and I would recommend her to all families. For a doctor that exhibits all the qualities needed to be a successful and great family doctor, go see Karima Ali - I promise you will not be disappointed. Even her support staff were carefully chosen - everyone from the receptionist to the nurses treated my children and me with compassion and care. Excellent service overall."
"Recently I moved to Courtice, Ontario after my husband got transferred. I have two children, ages 2 and 5 and knew that the move would be very difficult for them seeing as we moved from the states. Within the first month of moving in, our youngest child, Melanie, fell ill with the stomach flu and I began my frantic search for a new physician to replace our old doctor. After doing research on the internet, I came upon Dr. Arnold Lurie and am very pleased with my choice. Dr. Lurie was very friendly and understanding and always makes sure to fully explain what is going on so I am able to understand. Dr. Lurie is also very patient with my children and makes them comfortable, which I am very appreciative of. I can not praise their nurses or receptionists enough! Unlike many doctors, Dr. Lurie does not keep you waiting hours on end and does not appear to rush you. Overall, Dr. Lurie has made our move to Courtice much easier and I am very pleased with him as a doctor and would recommend him to anyone looking for a family practitioner. "
"Dr. Mark Mausner is a lovely man. Both my mother and my aunt got nose jobs at his office, and let me tell you, they look stunning. He is a true artist working in the medium that is the human body. In addition to his skill in the field, his office and staff are always very accommodating. The facility is top notch with cutting-edge medical technology -- it just goes to show how professional and truly caring Dr. Mausner is. The staff are always there to help and lend an ear when you need to vent. Having been in and out of the office because of my family members, I have to say that getting surgery there must be a truly remarkable experience. "
"Two weeks ago, Dr. Mark Mausner changed my life forever. I had Blepharoplasty and Restalyn injections for the first time. I can not believe how amazing I look! Dr. Mark Mausner was recommended to me by my sister who had the same procedure done and looked at least 7 years younger. I must admit I think he did an even better job on me. Dr. Mark Mausner was so comforting and reassuring about both the procedure and its results. He understood how my face was affecting how I felt about myself and took time in the initial consultation to help me develop a yearly schedule to keep my looks fresh and keep the cost affordable. His office staff is professional and friendly, and never waited longer than 16 minutes to see him. I would highly recommend Dr. Mark Mausner to anyone who is looking for a knowledgeable, skilled Plastic Surgeon who truly cares about his patients and wants to develop a long term relationship. "
"Dr. Mausner and his staff are fantastic! They offered the best customer service I've ever received from a doctor's office. From scheduling my appointment to pre-op procedures to the day of the surgery everything was handled in the most professional manner. I was referred by a friend and will definitely be recommending his practice to all my friends and family. His work is impeccable! No one knew I had the surgery done! Dr. Mausner communicated every detail of my surgery with an unmatched bedside manner. His talent as a surgeon plus his clean, well run practice is what will keep me and my family coming back for generations to come!"
"Dear Mark Mausner, I can't thank you enough for what you have done for me. You have giving me a new lease on life. Thanks to you and your wonderful staff for fixing my nose. After fixing my nose I can breathe so much better and my snoring is gone for good. Dr Mark you have made my life better and my wife say thank you too. Now she can get a full night of sleep with out me waking her up with my snoring. I would also like to say that the staff and facilities were top shelf and your staff went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and happy. Thank you so much Dr. Mark, I will tell all my friends about you and the wonderful work you do."
"Having plastic surgery is never an easy decision for someone to make. It is however probably one of the most important ones we make as the results can last a lifetime. Dr. Mausner made my experience so much easier than I thought. He was kind, and the staff was always supportive of me too. If I had to recommend a plastic surgeon to someone I would gladly tell them of my experience with Dr. Mark Mausner. As a patient you need to have complete confidence in your doctor and I can say Dr. Mausner instills that from the first moment you meet him. He helped to give me my life back. "
"When I first walked in, I was greeted right a way by the staff. They are very friendly. The place is clean and and inviting. The doctor was very gentle and understood my needs. I didn't feel like i was being pressured. I would definitely go back here. Highly recommended! "
"No complaints at all. Going into a doctor's office isn't the most comfortable experience in the world for me, but Dr. Mausner made me the most comfortable I could possibly be. He was friendly, knew what he was talking about, and I felt that he truely cared about me. If any of my friends needed work done, I would definently point them towards Dr. Mausner's direction."
"Doctor Mark Mausner was very professional during my visit. It was straight to business and I spent no more than 5 minutes in the waiting room. The office was very clean and Doctor Mausner was nice and polite the entire visit. I wont be going to any other doctor for my plastic surgery needs."
"This is a review for doctor Mark Mausner. I wanted to write this review because it is rare today to find someone who cares about you. Especially in the medical field. Dark Mausner is very polite and seems to genuinely care about his patients well being. He strives for nothing less than perfection. I will continue to come back to Dr. Mausner for all of my beauty needs. I have found my fountain of youth. Sincerly, The most grateful patient ever."
"Dr. Martin Jugenburg and his team performed my nose surgery procedure (rhinoplasty). I could not be happier with the results. Dr. Jugenberg sat with me and explained the procedure and also showed me "before and after" photos from his previous patients. I felt at ease speaking with him and he had a warm personality. He asked a lot of questions regarding what I had in mind in terms of the final appearance of my nose. He made sure that my expectations were realistic but he also seemed confident that I would end up happy. During the recovery time, the doctor or his nurse would call to check up on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. Dr. Jugenberg seems very professional and knowledgeable in the field of cosmetic surgery. I would recommend him to anyone looking for plastic or reconstructive surgery, and I am thrilled with the results."
"As a first time patient of Dr. Arnold Lurie, I was pleasantly surprised to have my visit go so well. The staff was exceptionally polite, the facility was immaculate, and wait time to been seen was almost immediately after I checked in. Dr. Lurie was friendly, very knowledgeable and experienced, and treated me with the utmost respect and compassion. I'm so glad to have finally found a physician I can trust, and take my whole family to!"
"I could not be happier with my recent experience at the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Clinic and Dr. Martin Jugenburg. The clinic was sparkly clean and the staff was courteous, discreet and professional. They thoroughly and patiently answered all my questions and cared for me with real kindness throughout my procedure. I healed fantastic and look and feel years younger! I have a new lease on life and a confidence I haven't felt in years! Thank you Dr. Jugenburg for all you have done for me! "
"I was very happy with the clinic and Dr. Martin Jugenberg. They all made me feel as if I was at home and didn't let the littlest thing pass without explaning it to me. After my surgery I was given after care notes in easy to understand even for my husband to understand. They also called the next couple days after surgery to make sure I was doing ok and if I have anymore questions. The best and wouldn't go any where else!"
"Dr. Martin Jugenburg is the best plastic surgeon in Toronto, He is attentive and knowledgeable. I feel like a brand new person, better than ever! I couldn't have asked for better results, no scarring and I look and feel FANTASTIC! His office is beautiful and his staff made me feel so at home! 5 out of 5 stars, I'll be back! "
"After having my son, my body was just not what it used to be. Months of dieting and exercise improved my figure, but there were some things I just couldn't fix on my own - extra skin, sagging breasts. After doing some careful research I chose to go in for a consultation with Dr. Martin Jugenburg. Once I met him and his friendly staff I knew this was the place for me to complete my transformation! I had a tummy tuck and lipo with fantastic results, and I WILL be returning to have my breasts enhanced in the future. Ladies - Just go in and meet with him! You won't want go to anywhere else once you do. "
"Dr. Jugenburg's mission is to strive for safety and satisfaction. When I visited Dr. Jugenburg, he and his team had only my interests in mind and listened to me and my wants and needs before he suggested anything. I am completely happy with my procedure and I could not have asked for anything better. Dr. Jugenburg was so wonderful through the consultations, surgery, and post-op treatment. I have no scarring and feel so much better about myself now. i would recommend Dr. Jugenburg for any cosmetic surgery!"
"I had been searching for a great surgeon for some time now. I have always had that "beer gut." When I first contacted the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, I was greeted by one of the nicest women I had ever talked to. She made it easy for me to set up a consultation and I was in within the next few weeks. I was paired with doctor Martin Jugenburg. Wow! I was so excited when I met him and I felt extremely comfortable and at ease with him. My biggest concern was about safety and I told this to Dr. Jugenburg. He assured me that he was very experienced and has been doing this for a long time. Once before I had gone to a different clinic and had a consultation but decided against it after the doctor was very rude to me and the cost was out of my price range. When I talked with Dr. Jugenburg, I felt like I was chatting with an old friend. And when I heard the price, I was shocked! The price was fair and a lot less than anywhere in the surrounding area! I decided to get a tummy tuck and was set up with an appointment. I'm not going to lie; it takes some time to recover and you will be sore. However, I am extremely satisfied with my results and that "beer gut" is no more! I appreciated all of the help and kindness that Dr. Jugenburg and his staff have given me. I go back for a checkup in about two weeks and I cannot wait until I am able to go swimming and not think about if other people are staring at my stomach. I can't wait! "
"Martin Jugenburg from Toronto Cosmetic Surgery was fantastic. I am a 63 year old woman, I had flabby arms. Dr. Jugenburg was helpful in helping me make the decision to have an Arm Lift. I am so pleased with the results. I can now wear tank tops and short sleeve shirts without being self conscious. Thanks Dr. Jugenburg. "
"Dr. Martin Jugenburg has changed my life completely! I was in a terrible accident and was burned severely. I couldn't even recognize myself. I just kept thinking to myself, I am never going to have a normal life from now on. I feared that anytime I went out into public, people would look at me like I am less than human. But shortly after I began to recover, I was informed of Dr. Jugenburg and reconstructive surgery. The thought of surgery scared me at first, but I would have to say it was one of the best experiences of my life. They took such good care of me and worked wonders! Thank you so much Dr. Jugenburg! You don't even know how thankful I am for what you have done for me. I now feel comfortable in own skin again and can enjoy going out into public once again."
"Thank you Dr. Elahi, Since my Abdominoplasty i look the way i have been wanting for years! I feel and look like i am 10 years younger. My husband cant keep his hands off me! You have changed my life. The staff made me feel so comfortable and the whole proceedure was explained so there were no suprises. I have tried everything to get the look and feel i wanted. Now i have the confidence to wear the cloths i wore before my kids. Thank you for your wonderful work! Cindy Monsato."
"Dr Mohammed M. Elahi is a pleasure to work with and I personally and highly recommend him. At first I was a little hesitant as this was my first time going through any kind of cosmetic work. Dr. Elahi made me feel comfortable and at ease when throughout my whole face lift procedure. He answered any and every question I had and his staff was also just as kind and helpful. After the several days of recovery, I got the results that I was looking for and I feel like a new person. I will definitely use Dr Elahi's services in the future If I consider getting more work done. "
"I recently went in to see Dr. Lurie at the Courtice Health Center because I was having issues with flu-like symptoms. Upon entering the office an assistant greeted me warmly and asked me my name. After a short 5 minute wait I was escorted through the well lit office and into a room where the nurse checked my height and weight. 10 minutes later Dr. Lurie entered the room and asked me what my issues were. He warmly asked questions with great concern, making me feel more at ease. I told him my symptoms included a slight fever, sore throat, vomiting, headache and an aversion to light. He took a swab to get a bacterial sample to determine what my sickness was. After that I left the doctors office for the day and the assistant told me they would call me in the morning to determine what was wrong with me. Total time at the doctors office was an amazing 30 minutes! The next day the Dr. Lurie called me personally and told me that I had a case of strep throat and he was going to put me on a series of antibiotics. He also stated that he'd just call the prescription into the nearest pharmacy and that I could pick it up at any time. Later that day I went to the pharmacy and picked up my meds, followed the instructions on the label and now 5 days later I'm fit as a fiddle! Thank you dr. Lurie, you're the best!"
"When I needed to have a breast lift done, I went to Dr. Elahi after a recommendation from a friend. I was extremely happy with both the care and the results; Dr. Elahi sat me down and guided me through exactly what I should expect from the surgery, and answered all of the questions I presented. During and after the procedure, he and his staff did their best to make sure I was comfortable and that I was healing correctly. I could not be happier with him, his practice, and his work!"
"Dr. Mohammed M. Elahi is a great cosmetic surgeon. I couldn't be happier with the work he did. Not only does he do great work, he also has a great personality and gave me the feeling that he actually cared about the end results, and not just getting my money. My decision to have cosmetic surgery wasn't an easy one to make, and once I decided to go ahead with it, I wanted to make sure I found the right Dr. Other doctors I visited just treated me like a number and didn't make me feel very comfortable. Dr. Elahi was different - he took his time with me and explained all the details of the procedure and took the time to answer my questions. I would recommend Dr. Elahi to anyone considering cosmetic surgery. "
"I've recently had some work done at the offices of Mohammed M. Elahi. The entire experience was pleasant. Dr. Elahi was very patient, answered all my questions and went over different options with me pror to my initial decision to receive some work. He did not in any way attempt to persuade me or coerce me into an operation. He simply presented me with the facts and allowed me to make up my mind. Once I decided, his bedside manner was fantastic. He made me feel very comfortable, and I was highly satisfied with the work. If I ever need another operation, I will use this same doctor. I was taken care of and cared for very well."
"Dr. Elahi is amazing. He was very patient with all of my questions, and did better than I ever could have hoped. I never thought that I could look this good. I feel like my life can finally begin now, thanks to him."
"To this day, I cannot thank Dr. Elhai enough for what he has given back to me. I had a severe cleft lip, which my family could not afford to fix through surgery. Thus, I would always find myself being picked on by other people during school. One time, the bullies were particularly mean and they decided that my face was apparently not ugly enough because they proceeded to pummel my face to a bloody pulp. Following weeks of emergency room recovery, my nose was contorted out of position due to it being fractured and both of my cheeks were misshaped due to their multiple fractures. The doctors in Whales said that there was nothing that they could possibly do due to the degree of damage done to my face. Needless to say, I was mortified; I didn't want my face to attract any more negative attention. "
"I visited Dr. Penelope Stalker and I was very satisfied with the way in which she took care of my medical problem. I have a rash on my elbows and she took the time to give me a thorough examination. She asked if I knew if I was allergic to any foods. Then, she prescribed an ointment that would take care of the problem after a few days of use. The most important part of the visit is that she actually took care of me and that I wasn't assigned to be seen by her assistant."
"Dr. Penelope Stalker, of Broadway Family Physicians, is a joy to work with. She was my doctor for an recent annual physical and did a great job. While being not only through, she asked many questions and answered many from me. She never seemed in a hurry to finish and her personality was made the experience as good as it could be. I would recommend Dr. Stalker without question."
"Broadway Family Physicians is an excellent medical practice. More specifically, Dr. Penelope Stalker is one of the most professional, knowledgeable, and caring medical practitioners that I have ever seen. Dr. Stalker's compassion for her patients is obvious and is thorough in identifying a proper diagnosis. I am generally very nervous about seeing physicians as I am not sure what they are going to say about my condition and how they will treat me, but Dr. Stalker put my mind at ease immediately. Her advice and treatment for my condition have been really helpful and I have been feeling much better. Thank you so much Dr. Stalker!"
"I have visited the office of Broadway Family Physicians and I am highly satisfied with the level of professional medical service by Dr. Penelope Stalker. From the moment I walked into the office, I felt like I finally found a place where attention was given to me. Dr. Penelope is very skilled and informative during each of my visits. All of my questions were answered from Dr. Penelope and I was not whisked out of the door as in the past when I went to ther family doctors. I am very happy that I found a place where I can get quality care for my family and I."
"Dr.Stalker is a very friendly and knowledgeable doctor! She has a lot of patience and is highly willing to explain everything about your options, medications and procedures to you, and makes great recommendations. She's efficient and doesn't make you wait too long, but gives enough time to each of her patients to make sure you feel comfortable. Plus, she's very reliable with regard to the quality of care you'll get. Excellent doctor!"
"Dr. Arnold Lurie has had much experience in the medical field and I feel very comfortable taking myself and my family to him for any reason. In my opinion, the best thing about seeing Dr. Lurie is that the appointments are very flexible and easy to schedule and the wait time is minimal. I have never had a better experience when it comes to a doctor."
"Penelope Stalker gave me a "Cadillac" experience. Not only was her staff friendly and knowledgeable, but I was seen by the doctor in a timely matter. I felt that she was effective and compassionate as well as an expert in her field. She made me extremely comforatable and I would recommend her to women and families. "
"I went to see Dr. Penelope Walker and she is by far one of the best doctors I have had the pleasure to visit. She was professional, and seemed to truly care about my medical issues. She helped in a compassionate and very professional manner and I highly recommend her to all my friends and family."
"All Physicians office's should take notes from Broadway Family! The entire appointment evolution was effortless and stress free. First off the receptionist greeted me and my son with our first names. The waiting area had an ample amount of activities to keep my son busy while we waited and was noticeably clean. Total time in the waiting area was 10 minutes. When we were called back we Dr. Penelope Stalker met us at the waiting room door. Dr. Stalker is a professional in all aspects. She put me and my son at ease the second she open the door with her genuine smile. Unlike other physicians i have seen, she spoke to me instead of down to me and even took the time to explain to my child the importance of regular check ups. When it was time for booster shots, she reassured my son that even though he would feel a slight prick, it would not hurt and even took the time to explain why shots were so important. At the conclusion of our appointment we were escorted to the waiting area by Dr. Stalker, were we were promptly addressed by the receptionist and on our way. My entire experience at Broadway Family Physicians was pleasant and comforting. "
"I recently had the privilege of going to see Dr. Penelope Stalker who practices with the Broadway Family Physicians. First of all, I was very impressed with how quickly I was able to get in and see Dr. Stalker for a medical issue that I would rather not mention. I called for an appointment on a Friday and was able to get in to see her by Monday the next week! Secondly, I was very pleased with how sincere and compassionate she was regarding my circumstances. It has been a long time since I have gone to see a doctor who has taken the time to understand my situation and work out a solution that is right for me. Needless to say I will definitely go back and see her again."
"Dr. Pierre Brassard, Md, is an incredible doctor. He takes time when consulting with patients, and listens to their every need and concern. The environment is free of stress, and every person included on the staff is willing to help you and answer any question you may have. The procedures are affordable and you will LOVE YOUR RESULTS!"
"Dr. Brassard was very professional and thorough. I was very impressed by his office and staff. They were all incredibly warm and helpful. I was very happy with the results and I would definitely recommend him."
"Dr. Brassard and his entire staff was courteous and polite. His was very nice and is a very good surgeon. I would definitely go to his practice again for anyy work that i needed."
"I found Dr. Pierre Brassard and his staff to be very professional and competent. My experience at his office was a very positive one. Dr. Brassard was very knowledgeable and caring in his approach to me and my concerns. I feel as though he was very thorough and gave me the best of care. I would recommend Dr. Brassard and his staff to anyone seeking quality medical care. Thank you."
"As a woman looking to get plastic surgery, feeling comfortable is very important. Dr Brassard and his staff went above and beyond to make me feel at home. I can't say thank you enough. The price was great and the results are fantastic. If you want a professional who knows how to treat people, then Dr Brassard is the way to go. "
"I recently visited Dr. Brassard for an appointment. The office staff were very cordial with getting me in without having to wait for weeks. I was skeptical at first, but after I researched his resume, I felt comfortable in seeing him. Not only is he accredited with numerous affiliations and achievements, but he's also been a professor. He took the time to explain my options, risks, and current research. I felt that he was speaking "to me" and not "at me." One can always tell that someone enjoys their craft, once they decide to teach it to others. I would highly recommend him to family and friends. "
"We are so thankful that we found Dr. Lurie as our family physician. He is wonderful with our children, and my partner and I feel comfortable with him as well. He is very knowledgeable, and was able to diagnose a chronic condition that several other doctors had missed previously. Great office, too - the staff is very friendly, the waiting area is good for families, and it is so convenient to have lab work and x-rays done in the same building. We could not be happier with Dr. Lurie."
"My name is Rich. Ever since I was a young kid I was teased relentlessly for my nose. There is what some would call a bump or hook on the top of it. Amy, my girlfriend of 3 years, heard about the great work of Dr. Pierre Brassard from her best friend and encouraged me to do a consult. Let me be clear, Amy loves me just the way I am, but she knows my insecurity and has heard my sad stories. At the consult Dr. Brassard was warm and friendly. He asked me questions about me as a total man treating me as a friend rather than potential patient. He actually suggested that he didn't even think I needed any work done on my nose! Ultimately he asked me if I cared to see any before and after pictures of patients who had decided to get work done. Of course, I agreed to see the pics. Dr. Brassard recommended that I go home, take a week or two to consider what I really wanted to do, and then call back with a decision or any questions. I spoke with Amy and we both agreed that although my condition wasn't life threatening and even though she loved me just the way I was, that if anyone was going to ever going to address this it should be a person like Dr. Brassard who questioned whether it was even necessary. Three days later I called the Dr. Brassard and told him my decision. Two months later we scheduled surgery. It was a conservative procedure and I was able to go home the next day. Amy and I decided to just shape the bump down a bit. Now I still look like myself, only better. My friends tell me I look great but they don't know why! They ask me if I am working out or on a special diet. This is what I wanted all along, yet never even knew before meeting Dr. Pierre Brassard. I was still myself, but a better version of me! Now I have so much confidence and most importantly the voices of torment from my youth are barely audible. Thanks Dr. Brassard for giving me back my joy. "
"Dr. Pierre Brassard is a truly amazing doctor, and you can tell he really cares about his patients. I went to him for some plastic surgery, and he made sure everything was right and that I was satisfied, and treated me with respect. I felt great after the operation, and Dr. Brassard made sure everything was done right. He does very high quality work, and guided me every step of the way after my surgery. It was an amazing experience, and I would definitely recommend him to a friend."
"I went to this doctor about one month ago for a face lift. I am 45 years old, and the wrinkles on my face look absolutely horrible. After only 4 days of prep, the surgery was only 1.5 hours long, and extremely easy to undergo, no pain. The results were absolutely astonishing! I look about 15 years younger, and I am a lot more confident and happy with my life. Would definitely recommend Dr. Brassard!"
"I visited Dr. Rafik Bechbache office on referal from a friend. I found the building to kept quite nicely and the office staff was very friendly and helpful with my insurance information. When the nurse came to get me she was quite pleasant and took my blood pressure with a bit of concern and said she would let the Dr, know it was a bit high. I did find the room a bit chilly but I didn't have to wait long to see the Doctor. When he arrived he aske me how I was and what I was being seen for and I gave him a brief description and background. We made some small talk about fishing and so forth and he asked my family background. I found this visit quite helpful and will be changing my family over to his practice. Thanks!!!"
"Dr. Bechbache has been our family physician for several years now. I wouldn't take my family to anyone else if I didn't have to. Dr. Bechbache genuinely listens to your complaints and makes you feel like you and your health really matter to him."
"I have been a patient of Dr. Rafik Bechbache for the past three years. I am very pleased with the service that I receive. The waiting time is very minimal. Dr. Bechbache takes the time that I need to completely answer all of my questions to the fullest extent possible and also gives other suggestions that will help me in my personal health goals. I was referred to Dr. Bechbache from a friend and I am very happy being a patient of Dr. Bechbache's family practice clinic. The staff is very friendly and the doctor is very well versed in family practice issues. I would recommend Dr. Bechbache to all my friends and family and also share with them how pleased I am to be a patient of Dr. Bechbache's clinic."
"Rafik Bechbache is the definition of an outstanding family physician. I have referred several patients to him because of his keen and adept skills in the medical field. He will be able to answer any question, about anything medical related. The great thing is, that he is also available to non-English speakers, more specifically French speakers. He is a very understanding physician and takes his time to fully analyze each and every patient. I would recommend Dr. Bechbache in a heartbeat to anyone. "
"I went to Dr. Rafik for a routine checkup for my whole family. He and his staff were very professional and they made our family feel comfortable with the care we received. I would recommend him to any family."
"I am not one to normally write a review. But I want to let you know about Dr. Rafik Bechbache, my families truly gifted doctor. As our family physician he has gone out of his way to provide superior service, he has been available at all times of the day and night, and has accurately diagnosed and treated our families' sicknesses and illnesses for the time we have known him. Supported by the quality staff at Markham Stouffville Hospital I don't know what we did before he was our doctor. He has certainly improved my life and the lives of my family. Thanks Doctor Bechbache. "
"Was always kind and understanding. We have been going to this doctor for many years and have always felt a warm environment. It's nice to be treated as a person and not just a number!"
"Dr. Arnold Lurie has been my doctor years. He exhibits the best professional attitude that a patient could ask for. He's thorough and accurate. I never have to wait an unreasonable amount of time, and the office is always extremely clean. His staff is warm and welcoming. When I am there, I have his attention 100% of the time. That is very difficult to find in any doctor these days. I highly recommend Dr. Lurie."
"Dr. Bechbache has treated my entire family for the past five years and we absolutely love him! Dr. Bechbache has excellent bedside manner and is considerate and kind when dealing with his patients. When a cyst was found in my neck, Dr. Bechbache did not treat me routinely, like a number, but rather treated me like a friend. His experience and professionalism helped get me through a very scary situation. The typical wait for office visit is about 10 minutes and he takes the time to sit and talk with his patients. I would highly recommend Dr. Bechbache to anyone who is seeking a caring, experienced family doctor. "
"Dr. Bechbache was great. I went in because I had a chest cold. It turned out that I had an upper respiratory infection. Dr Bechbache was able to easily diagnose and get me the proper medication. The doctor was friendly and warm. Didn't make me feel stupid, but was really glad I came in. So was I. I would definitely reccomend the doctor to anyone and everyone in the area."
"Dr. Davis did an amazing job on my rhinoplasty surgery. I came from Georgia and his website helped me with information on South Florida and how to find his office. I was very impressed at his lengthy credentials and that is why I chose him in the first place. Very good visit"
"Mr Richard Davis is everything that modern doctors lack. His bedside manner is top notch. He took the time to explain all of my options to me in a way I couldn't understand. I got the impression he was talking to me,not at me,as some medical professionals do. He was very warm and kind after the procedure. He fully explained to me what was going to happen during and after the surgery,and made sure i was 100% comfortable and ready for the next stage. Mr Davis also called the next morning to make sure I was not experiencing anything out of the ordinary,and told me to call his office if anything changed with my recovery. During my follow up visit,he was very patient with my questions and concerns. He made me feel that if there was every a problem or issue,that his office was available to me. I also got a postcard in the mail a week after thanking me for my business,along with a nice card. I would recommend Dr Davis to anyone else looking for a quality doctor that will take his time to make sure your comfortable with the process from begining to end. "
"Dr. Davis is a wonderful physician! First, he came in on-time for the scheduled appointment. If you have had experiences like me, you know we usually wind up waiting 30min, 45min, and sometimes 1 hour for the doctor to actually come in for the appointment. Dr. Davis was on schedule. This impressed me, as it shows he has respect for my time. Meanwhile, from the moment he walked in I had his undivided attention. He was very attentive to my needs, and answered all my questions. He is very easy to talk to about your medical issues. I was also very impressed with his knowledge. Overall, Dr. Davis is exceeded my expectations! "
"Dr. Davis is a fabulous doctor. His office is very neat and well kept and all of the office staff were very friendly. Dr. Davis was extremely friendly and helpful and gave me the best advice in my time of need. Recommending him to all of my friends!"
"Before Doctor Richard Davis, I was in trouble. I had a deviated septum that not only made it hard to breathe, but hard to sleep. It seemed like every few minutes my mind would be taken away from whatever I was doing and I actually had to concentrate on breathing. For a long time I actually thought this was normal! But that was before I met Dr. Davis. His scheduling staff was thoughtful and nice, and the Doctor himself very professional. I wasn't just a paycheck to him, but a patient. He talked to me for almost an hour about the concerns I had to fix my problem, and just generally made me feel very comfortable. The surgery went great, and now I can breathe again! Thank you Doctor Davis."
"I have had issues with my nose since I was a teenager. As I aged, my insecurities grew to terrible heights. When I decided to actually do something, Dr. Davis was the name that I kept hearing about. My nerves were calmed immediately by a caring staff. The nurses and aides have always been extremely compassionate and considerate, polite and professional, but most of all, they were all very 'real' and easy to talk to and deal with. Dr. Davis is incredible. He explained my options after actually listening to my concerns. He thoroughly explained the procedure, and on the day of surgery, he arrived early to chat with me and calm my fears. My aftercare has been nothing short of amazing. The staff is always a pleasure, and Dr. Davis has seen me on each appointment, pre and post surgery. I would reccomend him to anybody who asked for my opinion."
"I have been self-conscious about my size of my nose since I was a little girl. I went into Dr. Davis' office for a consultation regarding a possible rhinoplasty. During the consultation, Dr. Davis' bedside manner was excellent; he made me feel quite at ease and calmed my fears about the surgery. Based on my experience then I chose to go ahead with the surgery. My results have been stunning! I have never felt so beautiful in my life! Thank you Dr. Davis!"
"He seems like he knows what he's doing. I know that many females seek plastic surgery due to low self-confidence. Dr. Davis would be a great doctor to turn to when needing a trusting doctor who knows what he's doing. When a doctor is dedicated to his work, that makes the patient more comfortable dealing with decisions involving that doctor. Dr. Davis is a prime example. Although I'm neutral in deciding whether or not plastic surgery is a good thing for people, sometimes getting plastic surgery gives some the confidence they need to get through the day. There are people who get made fun of and put down because of the way they look, and I'm sure, in some people's eyes, Dr. Davis is considered a hero. When you make someone feel from depressed to confident, it changes that person's whole world around. So thank you Dr. Davis. Plastic surgery is an option. Those who choose it probably thank you as well."
"My experience with Dr. Leblanc last Thursday was perfect. I was greeted with a smiling face and the lobby was welcoming. The publications were current and the wait was seemingly non-existent. Dr. LeBlanc was extremely professional and knowledgeable. My questions were answered in full and I did not feel rushed. I will absolutely trust my care and beauty in the hands Dr. Leblanc."
"Let me start by saying that I was skeptical about having any kind of "work" done. I was afraid that it would be over the top and noticeable in a negative way, but I couldn't stand the thought of my extremely large nose dominating my wedding photos and the wedding was less than a year away. So, I took my doubts to Dr. Richard Davis after a recommendation by a close friend of mine. Dr. Davis took the time to explain exactly what changes he would make and how my nose would then work with the rest of my facial features instead of standing out. After hearing how reassuring and confident Dr. Davis was I decided to go ahead with the procedure and I'm so glad that I did. Dr. Davis did such an amazing job, I couldn't be happier and my wedding pictures prove it. I'm not one to brag on myself but I looked amazing that day. Dr. Davis didn't just improve my looks, he improved my self-image and my life."
"My experience with Robert Backstein has been nothing but a good one. I went to him for a tummy tuck after I had my first baby. I was very nervous at first but Dr. Backstein put my worries at ease! His positive attitude helped with my anxiety, and he was great at answering all my questions!"
"I first learned of Dr. Backstein when I read his article about the pros and cons of liposuction. My first phone call to schedule my initial consultation was met by an understanding receptionist who immediately booked my appointment. At my first consultation with Dr. Backstein, he spent almost two hours with me going over my chart and my liposuction options including the overall risks and what he thought was the preferred choice of liposuction for me. He also spent time going over the prices, which was an important factor to me. Overall, my first impression of Dr. Backstein was very good. I came away informed of the risks, but felt comfortable that I was making the right choice of cosmetic surgeon. Dr. Backstein also met with me pre-operation to go over all of my questions and answered them fully. I was prepared for the procedure and knew I was in good hands. After the surgery and recovery was completed, Dr. Backstein visited with me to make sure that I was satisfied and followed up with me three months later to check on my status. Of course, the surgery was a success and I'm looking forward to every day now. Thank you Dr. Backstein!"
"Dr. Robert Backstein's ethics are admirable. The focus of his practice is to ensure that his patients are given an individual approach to cosmetic surgery and are well-informed on the procedures they are considering. By focusing on his patient's individual needs, Dr. Backstein is not only preparing his clients for the physical changes of cosmetic surgery but is also helping them through the psychological process of making such major changes and decisions. Because of his high standards of care, I am confident that Dr. Backstein is the right doctor for me and look forward to working with him in the future. "
"Doctor Robert Steven Backstein has worked diligently in the cosmetic surgery field for twelve years as a qualified doctor. Additionally, he holds a fellowship in the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada. In consulting with Doctor Backstein, patients will undoubtedly feel quite at ease with his procedures and techniques. Moreover, Doctor Backstein feels that understanding is key to his practice. Doctor Backstein may be quoted as saying, "patients should understand their options and have an understanding of the procedures they are considering." All in all, Doctor Robert Backstein is a reputable and caring professional in the cosmetic surgery field and should be considered when a patient is weighing the options of cosmetic surgery in the Toronto area. Consequently, Doctor Backstein has spent many labor intensive hours writing articles that will put patients at ease while adding a great amount of information for future success stories as well. "
"Let me just say that I could not be more pleased with the work done by Dr. Backstein. I had breast implants done and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. Both Dr. Backstein and the staff were extremely helpful throughout the entire process. The results are exactly like I thought they would be. I would certainly reccommend him a friend. "
"Dr. Backstein was wonderful. He was friendly and helpful walking me through my procedure and his level of professionalism was very comforting. I would highly recommend him."
"I am very pleased with the service and results I received at Dr. Backstein's practice. I was treated with respect and confidentiality throughout the whole process. The staff is kind and very accommodating. Dr. Backstein was very honest with me and possessed an excellent bed side manner. I would definitely recommend him and his practice. "
"Dr. Backstein was a fantastic surgeon and a pleasure to have as a doctor! I went in for a simple procedure and I was concerned about how it would go. He answered all of my questions and gave me a lot of information about it prior to the surgery. He was kind, friendly, and incredibly warm which helped to ease my mind about the upcoming surgery. By the time we had arranged for the surgery, I was very confident about it. I felt like he truly cared about me as an individual and I felt at ease being in his hands for the surgery. I would definitely recommend him in the future!"
"I recently saw Dr. Robert Backstein to get cosmetic reconstructive surgery on my nose, as I had recently been in a terrible car accident. Dr. Backstein and his staff were very accommodating and friendly, and were there every step of the way to help me through my surgery and my recovery process. At first I was nervous about getting surgery, but after speaking with Dr. Backstein all of my fears were alleviated. The doctor was very knowledgeable and was able to answer any questions I had in a professional manner. I would recommend this practice to my friends and family anytime. For more information go to the website www.cosmeticsurgerytoronto.com, there you will find contact information for the wonderful staff and I am confident they respond to and questions or concerns promptly. "
"I have been a very loyal and satisfied patient of Dr. Benoit LeBlanc for about five years now. I was referred to Dr. LeBlanc by a close friend, and initially met with him to discuss a breast augmentation surgery. I was immediately impressed with his professionalism and the care he took to ensure my comfort. After my surgery, I was very pleased with the results. I had minimal scarring, and I healed very quickly. Two years ago, Dr. LeBlanc performed liposuction and a tummy tuck, and I was again amazed at the results. He has a wonderful bedside manner, and truly takes the time to talk to his patients and get to know them. In the operating room, he has a natural talent, and his work is superb. I have almost no scarring, and the bruising/discomfort after both of my procedures was nothing like what I anticipated. In the future, should I ever decide to have more work done, there is no other surgeon I would trust with my body than Dr. LeBlanc. He is, in my opinion, one of the best cosmetic surgeons in the country. "
"Dr. Robert Wolf is an exemplary medical professional in the cosmetic surgery field. He is very attentive and during my visit made me feel knowledgeable about the procedures I was to undergo. He was able to provide me with information in simple terms that allowed me to feel more at ease about the procedures. After the operation I was very impressed with his work, which is worth the cost several times over. I highly recommend him to anyone. "
"Knowing that Dr. Wolf has over 18 years of experience as a plastic surgeon made me feel more at ease about having my deviated septum corrected. During our initial consultation, Dr. Wolf was very patient and seemed to show a genuine interest in all of my concerns, and took the time to thoroughly explain how the surgery would work, how long it would take to recover, possible complications, and other information that I felt was important to know. After the surgery, Dr. Wolf came to see me at the the bedside to follow up with me and see how I'm doing, which was a great gesture that I had not expected. Two months after the surgery, my nose looks good, I can breathe great, and I can honestly say that Dr. Wolf did an outstanding job!"
"Dr. Wolf thank you so much for renewing my self confidence in myself. I didn't think I would ever look normal again until I "Put myself in your hands". You really are a wizard."
"I was referred to Dr. Wolf by a friend of mine. They had used him in the past and highly suggested his practice. I was able to schedule my initial consultation online and was able to be seen later the same week. Once I was in the office, the scheduling nurse was extremely nice and friendly. After signing in, it only took me a few minutes to be lead to the room to meet with Dr Wolf. He was extremely knowledgeable about my procedure and has done many of them over his long tenure. Recovery time was about what I expected with no complications. Even the followup appointment had the same speed to get in and out, but I never felt rushed. I would highly suggest Dr Wolf to anyone looking to have some work done."
"Dr. Wolf and his staff were very welcoming and professional, from the very first time I called to make and appointment. During my consultation, Dr. Wolf took the time to listen to my questions and concerns and provided honest, thoughtful and helpful answers. I did not feel rushed or pressured, and it seemed like he really wanted to make sure I made the best decision to suit my body type and my needs. He showed me plenty of before and after photos to give me a realistic idea of what my outcome could be and really put me at ease. He was also able to do my botox injection in the same visit, which he did quickly and expertly. I can't wait to schedule my surgery with Dr. Wolf!"
"Dr. Wolf is one of the most personable and thorough cosmetic surgeons I have hadthe pleasure of meeting and working with. In light of all the misconceptions about cosmetic surgeons, he is a welcome respite for patients who are not sure if they even need anything done. He lessens their fears and explains every option available to them. This practice as well has a very comforting feel so that even in the waiting room potential patients can relax and take a deep breath. Cosmetic surgery can make people nervous to contemplate but a place like Dr. Wolf's office is a place to relax and approach things calmly (which is a good change!). Were I to consider a cosmetic surgeon I would gladly see Dr. Wolf."
"Based on recommendations from friends, I sought out Dr. Robert Wolf at Waters Edge for consultation on a tummy tuck procedure. Two abdominal surgeries had left me with an asymmetrical scar and lots of unattractive skin puckering. I was a bit nervous, but the office surroundings were so soothing! I loved the waterfall - very relaxing. I found Dr. Wolf to be extremely professional and highly compassionate. He discussed a number of options with me, and after our meeting I felt very confident in his ability to provide me with a good surgical outcome. I was very pleased with the results of my surgery. I feel like I'm bikini-worthy again and would not hesitate to consult Dr. Wolf again if I have future cosmetic surgery needs."
"I want to express my over-whelming gratitude at the loving care I received last week at Assiniboine Medical Clinic. I had a wonderful experience and received intelligent and compassionate care from the moment I arrived. I was greeted with a kind hello by the receptionist, was promptly taken to an interview room by Dr. Russell Albak's nurse, and was treated with dignity by both Dr. Russell Albak and his nurse. I was promptly seen by Dr. Albak. He was pleasant, and took a long time with me reviewing my various symptoms. He was reassuring, and informative. He offered free samples of the medicine that he prescribed. He gave me some literature to help me understand my condition. I felt so completely at ease with Dr. Albak, and I trusted him completely. I would recommend Dr. Albak to all of my family and friends. "
"I went to see Dr. Albak for the first time today after researching their website. I was checked in promptly and taken back to an exam room within just a few minutes where my vital signs were taken. After a short wait, the Dr. came in, washed his hands, shook my hand and welcomed me to their practice. He listened attentively while I described my symptoms while taking notes on his laptop. He asked me a few questions then examined me and discussed treatment in laymen's terms I could understand. I was very impressed with Dr. Albak's courtesty and professionalism, and believe I have finally found a doctor who really cares about my health. There is a LOT of information on their website, including contact numbers, hours, and all of the services their clinic offers. Two thumbs up...I highly recommend Dr. Albak! "
"Dr Russell Albak was great when we had to bring our young son Joshua in because he'd tripped going down the stairs to the basement. Fortunately he didn't land on his head, but it turned out that he had managed to get a concussion anyway, and Dr. Albak was able to tell from how he was acting. He checked out both his legs and his arms too, and Joshua had a sprain so his arm will have to be in a sling for a week or so. Normally when we see Dr. Albak Joshua gets a big lollypop, but because of the concussion he can't have one today but when he comes in next week for a follow-up Dr. Albak said he could have two, and Joshua is excited for that."
"Dr. Benoit LeBlanc is one of the most experienced doctors in the field of Cosmetic Surgery. He uses the utmost care, and has an excellent bedside manner. He and his staff answer each question with professionalism, and care."
"I visited Dr. Albak a few weeks ago when I was experiencing severe pain in my back. The office is always very accommodating to me, and I did not want to have to visit the ER. The wait time was not long, and the nurse continually checked on me, I felt even though I was a walk in, that I was a priority for them. When I spoke to Dr. Albak, he told me that he was 98% sure that the symptoms I was describing were related to a kidney stone. He was undoubtedly right! After all the proper tests and scans I indeed had a kidney stone @ the age of 25! With all of his experience I trust Dr. Albak to guide me in the right direction in preventing the re-occurrence of kidney stones in the future."
"Dr. Albak is a wonderful doctor. Firstly, he was very timely and did not make me wait very long past my scheduled appointment time. He made me feel very comfortable from the moment I walked into patient room. He was kind and understanding of my questions and concerns and he took his time to answer them in a way that I could understand. I would recommend Dr. Albak to anyone."
"I took my kid to Doctor Russell Albak, and as you all know, this being my first time with this doctor made me on my toes. Luckily, very quickly I realized that this is a doctor that is very patient with his patients, no matter their age, and willing to listen to all the side effects you have, and will even go step by step with you through all his procedures. He is calm, very detail oriented, and is very easy to talk to. But, the best part is that my kid, who usually puts up a fit at any doctors office, actually enjoyed going to the doctor here. At first my son was reluctant to open up, but after a while he was happily talking away not even realizing that he already got his shot. Doctor Russell Albak is a fantastic doctor, and I will make sure to stay with this doctor for a long time."
"i have been a patient with Dr. Russell Albak for 15 years now. I am thankful to have found such a caring family physican. He delivered both of my children and continues to care for them in their teens. The hours are convinent. The open clinic hours are so convient. My youngest child was diagnoised with diabetes. we have gotten state of the art treatment for him. There is a nutritionist that Dr Russell Albak set us up with. MAking a difficult condition manageable. he got my little boy a special book to expalin diabetes to him. It is extremely important that they have onsite labs. Dr Russell Albak was kind of enough to instruct that I needed a butterfly ne edle when I get my blood drawn because my vein rolled. It cured a life long fear of needles. Dr. Russell Albak takes the time to talk to me not at me. "
"When we moved to the Winnipeg Manitoba area, we were referred to the Assiniboine Medical Clinic for our new family physician. We had a positive experience starting with calling for the appointment. The office staff was very pleasant and was able to get us in within a couple weeks. Upon arriving at the office, instead of filling out all the new forms ourselves, Dr. Albak took the time to ask us the questions himself, giving us time to better explain our health and family situations. The exam was very thorough and we did not feel rushed. He took the time to explain what he was going and why. Upon completion of the exam, he explained what we should do to better our health, then asked "What will you do?" and then we went from there. I was very pleased with our new doctor."
"My family and I have been patients of Dr. Albak's for almost ten years at the Assinibone Medical Clinic. He has always been available to us in any emergency situation, and there have been alot with three sons. He spends the time to find out what is wrong, how we are feeling and what we think is a good medical treatment. He is friendly, considerate and professional. His staff is also friendly, considerate and professional. I would recommend him to anyone as your family doctor. The hours the clinic is available is great plus the walk-in hours are excellent. Assinibone Medical Clinic and Dr. Albak can take care of all your medical needs and emergencies. I highly recommend them to anyone needing a healthcare facility and doctor."
"Over the last few years I became aware of excess skin and fat accumulation above my eyelids. I felt awkward at times feeling that others were not looking directly at me but instead my eyelids. One of my friends recommended that I visit Doctor Sheina Macadam. My friend confided in me that she had cosmetic surgery performed for the exact same issue a couple of years earlier and was very happy with the results. So following her recommendation I made an appointment to see Doctor Macadam. Initially I felt awkward and unsure talking about cosmetic surgery. Doctor Macadam was very open, friendly and patient in explaining what she could offer to help. She didn't rush the consultation and explained what my options were. I decided to have a blepharoplasty (the medical term for the procedure to reduce unwanted fat and skin hanging above the eyelids) performed. I was fully informed before the operation what to expect immediately after the surgery was completed. My surgery lasted only a couple of hours and I was able to return home the same day. I had no complications or surprises. Thanks to the skills of Doctor Sheina Macadam and her professional staff, my eyelids now look like I used to when I was younger. I no longer feel awkward about how I look and feel. I would recommend Doctor Sheina Macadam to anyone who wishes to look and feel better about themselves."
"I have always felt comfortable at Dr. Sheina Macadam's office. She is extremely knowledgable and won't push you towards options you are not comfortable with. She is willing to sit down over multiple sessions to make sure you get the results you want. And when you go in for your surgery, you'll go into a welcoming and clean OR, and then go into a home-styled recovery room. You won't be disappointed in the results."
"I visited Dr. Sheina Macadam to see what my options were following a rather massive weight loss. I was happy to be so much thinner but my main goal, to be able to show off my new body, was impossible with all of the loose skin. Dr. Macadam assured me that abdominoplasty could solve my problem. Fast forward a month and I am very pleased with the results. It took me a week or so to get back to my normal routine but I think the results will allow me to actually visit the beach this year without a shirt on. I haven't done that since high school so it will be a huge life change for me. I am pleased with the results. I also want to throw in a little extra credit for Dr. Macadam's personal skills. She made me feel at ease from the very beginning and this pleasant "bedside manner" helped me get through the process with some confidence."
"Dr. Macadam is a very good doctor. First off, the wait time to be seen is very short--around 5-10 minutes. The receptionists at the front are very friendly. They make filling out the initial paperwork very easy and are very willing to help you if you have questions. The nurses are also very helpful. They seem very knowledgeable and make you feel at ease. The facilities are also very clean. The equipment is brand new and state of the art. Dr. Macadam is a very kind doctor--she is very good at listening when you tell her your concerns. She is very detail oriented and thorough. After the surgery, she follows up with you personally and makes sure everything is ok. I had a few concerns and when she saw me, I was reassured that there was not anything to be concerned about."
"Doctor Aboolian is a rare breed of doctor. In my experience, he is the gold standard for doctors. He is calm and confident, focuses on using medicine to make life better, and can explain really complicated topics simply and openly. His clients are elite, and that's only fitting - Doctor Aboolian is about as elite as they come. Cosmetic surgery demands the best doctors and surgeons with the most experience and deepest intellect. They also have to understand what me, as a patient, feels from initial consultation to post-op. This doctor's worth it."
"Dr. LeBlanc is a truly caring cosmetic surgeon. I consulted with him to improve myself, and he was there for me every step of the way. Not only were the results of my surgery fantastic, but the atmosphere and the interest Dr. LeBlanc took in me were phenomenal. The best part of the whole experience was that Dr. LeBlanc communicated with me at every step of the process: before, during and after the surgery. I would highly recommend Dr. LeBlanc to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery. "
"Dr. Sheina Macadam is a helpful "do it right the first time" doctor who encourages healthy lifestyles. Dr. Macadam does this by teaching healthy eadtin habits and other such preventative care. All of Macadams patients recieve a full diagnosis and prognosis pertaining to their overall health at the time of treatment. Macadam and her associates always make patients feel at home while providing expertise."
"After visiting Dr. Sheina Macadam's office I feel very confident in choosing her as my cosmetic surgeon. She was very honest in going over my options and just as honest in what wouldn't be an option for me. She told me both the pro's and the con's and we discussed what I would most comfortable with and what would be most beneficial. While going over the different surgical options she made sure I was aware of possible side effects, infections etc and explained to me post-surgical care. I am sure to recommend Dr. Shaina Macadams to anyone."
"Doctor Sheina Macadam was the best surgeon i have ever seen in my long life! The best in her profession. The medical procedure went flawlessly. I was given an excursion into to the complex surgery before hand. "
"Dr. Macadam and her support staff were courteous and very knowledgeable about the cosmetic surgery I was considering. They very clearly outlined the pros and cons of the reconstruction procedure. They took the time to answer all of my questions regarding the procedure and, most important to me, the after care required when the surgery was completed. I highly recommend Dr. Macadam for any type of cosmetic or reconstructive surgery you may be considering."
"I am beyond satisfied with the results from my surgery. I sought out Dr. Macadam in hope of getting a tummy tuck. I had recently lost a lot of weight and had annoying flabby skin around my stomach that I could NOT get rid of no matter what I did. She walked me though the procedure. I was taken care of quickly. The healing process was fast and my scarring is very minimal. You wouldn't know I had work done unless you really looked at me. I can't thank her enough for that and my new, totally flat stomach! "
"The teenage years can be especially cruel, especially if you're a girl with a crooked nose. My parents could not afford the cost of rhinoplasty but I knew one day I would have surgery. When I graduated from college I decided to take the plunge and call Dr. Valnicek. He listened to my concerns, showed me some before and after photos of his patients. The cost of the surgery was very reasonable. His staff was very caring and considerate. It's been three months since my procedure. I'm completely healed. I love my new nose! "
"I could not more highly recommend Dr. Valnicek to anyone looking for reconstructive or plastic surgery. He has a wonderful bedside manner and I always felt as though I was in safe hands. My breast augmentation post mastectomy turned out beautiful. I feel as though I am complete again thanks to Dr. Valnicek."
"Stan valnicek is a really good surgeon. He is very professional and was very careful. He has a solid background and has many years experience. I recoverd from the surgery on my face very quickly and you can hardly tell i had anything done to my nose"
"My experience with Dr. Valnicek was excellent. I had been suffering from low self esteem due to gynecomastia. After suffering from it for years, I met Dr. Valnicek, who quickly turned everything around. Everything was handled quickly and efficiently and now I can safely say that I'm happier than I ever have been."
"Well I had a deviated septum that was causing some sleeping problems (apnea) and was referred to Dr. Valnicek from an Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist as being the best in British Columbia. Immediately felt comfortable with the Dr. Valnicek as he told me exactly what the procedure involved and answered any doubts I had. The surgery was done within a couple of weeks and ran smoothly like I had expected. He made sure every step of the way was comfortable and rehab was a breeze under his direct care. It was my first time getting surgery of any kind and the doctor made all my doubts go away with his care."
"I needed to see Dr. LeBlanc for some medical issues I had been having. I phoned the clinic the schedule one in, and the office staff were professional and knowledgable. I was able to get an appointment within the week. When I arrived for my appointment, the staff was again professional and friendly, and the nurse came to get me quickly so I didn't have to wait long. Dr. LeBlanc came into the room within five minutes, listened to my concerns and addressed each concern thoroughly. He also asked several questions and recommened a medication-in which he called in to the pharmacy right away. I appreciated that I was able to see the doctor, and not some PA in his place. After all, I pay for a DOCTOR appointment, not a PA. It's been one week since my appointment and I am feeling great!"
"I can not say enough wonderful things about Dr. Valnicek and his staff. The staff was so warm and welcoming and I felt right at ease as soon as I walked in the door for my first visit. Aside from being an exceptional surgeon, Dr. Valnicek always treated me with the utmost professionalism and respect. I am thrilled with my results and would recommend Dr. Valnicek and the Okanagan Plastic Surgeons office to everyone. Thank you for a great experience. Another happy patient!"
"I went to see Dr. Stan Valnicek to have a deviated septum repaired and at the same time decided to have a bump removed from the middle of my nose. Dr. Valnicek spoke to me in terms that I had no difficulty understanding. He and his staff were very warm and made me feel at ease during a time that is normally very stressful. His aftercare was just as caring and my recovery time was minimal with very little swelling or discomfort. I would definitely go to see Dr. Valnicek for my next procedure."
"From the moment I walked into Dr. Valnicek's office, I knew I was in the right place. Like many people, I was nervous and skeptical about cosmetic surgery but Dr. Valnicek helped change my view on cosmetic surgery and made me feel right at home. I definitely didn't want the fake plastic surgery look and Dr. Valnicek knew exactly what I was talking about. I explained how much younger I felt on the inside and how agitated I was with the crow's feet around my eyes. Dr. Valnicek immediately understood how I felt and shared what needed to be done to fix my little problem. Even though I planned on just checking into cosmetic surgery, I was sold. About a month later, I was checking in for my procedure. Dr. Valnicek did a great job of explaining what was going to happen and how he was going to do it. And wow, the results were amazing! Since that time, I've shared my experience with close friends, two of which have chosen to also have elective cosmetic surgery (liposuction and a tummy tuck) and agree the results are astounding. Now, I look the age I feel. My friends can hardly believe how much younger a simple procedure can improve your look and I love getting checked out by everyone at the grocery store again! Take my advice, talk to Dr. Valnicek and you won't be dissapointed. "
"I got a breast augmentation and lift from Dr. Valnicek. They look great!!! The swelling has finally gone down and I'm very happy with the results. The doctor and his staff were very nice and the surgery went without a hitch. Highly recommended!!!!"
"Dr. Hunter is a family favorite of ours. Anytime we are concerned or do not understand things she takes her time to make sure we are assured and all of our questions have been completely answered before we leave her office. She is very kind and very genuine, we never feel that she is not genuinely concerned. The staff is great as well, always pleasant and helpful. We will continue to see Dr. Hunter for years to come."
"During a recent visit to the Family Practice run by Susan Hunter of the St. Joseph's General Hospital, I was genuinely surprised by the staff. They went to great lenghts to ensure me and my child were comfortable during what at the time felt like a scary situation. Everyone took the time to explain what was happening, why and made sure my son was comfortable. Needless to say I think her and her staff are top notch and will not be taking my son anywhere else!"
"We moved into the area recently and did not know many people. My son having mild asthma needed a doctor for a virus he was having. We called several peditircians in the area and were told that they were not accepting new patients on a sick care basis. Well my son needed medical attention and I called St. Josephs. I did not want to have to take him to the hospital because it is expensive. They referes me to Dr. Hunter - I was able to get in for an appointment that day and get my son the care he needed. They were very friendly on the phone and understanding of our needs to see someone today. Dr. Hunter was very friendly to my son and made him feel comfortable by asking him about his new school and paying attention that we had recently moved here. She was able to write the script for the meds we needed and recommended a close pharmacy to where we lived and they called in the scritp for us. I felt hopeless that we would not get my son into an office for his care that day, but the offices of Dr. Susan Hunter gave us the hope we needed."
"Dr. Susan Hunter is an excellent physician. As one of her patient's I feel I am in good hands. Whenever I visit her practice, the staff is polite and friendly. The office area is organized, clean, and quiet. Dr. Hunter treats me in a very gentle manner whenever I go to see her. No matter how busy the office is, she always takes time out to listen to my concerns and address them. I feel very confident in Dr. Hunter's expertise and plan to keep her as my primary care physician."
"I would highly recommend Dr. Hunter and her practice. She is knowledgeable and has excellent staff on hand. Her practice is one I would trust for myself and my family."
"Overall, the attention that I received from Susan Hunter and her staff was great. Upon entering the office, I did not feel stressed in any way. The people there are friendly and helpful rather than irritable. The staff does not interrogate you to make you feel uncomfortable in any way. I have been to too many other practices that have terrible environments; the office is always crowded and noisy, and the place isn't terribly welcoming. When coming into Susan Hunter's office, there is a warm atmosphere filled with friendly people. Susan herself is a fantastic doctor. All of my children feel comfortable around her, and they are not afraid to talk to her about any problem. Because of this, my they can get the proper attention that they need. She has always provided the best options for treatments, keeping in mind the budget that we follow. If we did not have Susan in the area, then we may never get better and still keep our wallets! When a member of my family is sick, I know that I can rely on Susan Hunter and her family practice to give the care that is needed."
"This doctor is the best one I have had so far in all of my years of seeing them. He has all the traits of a real professional. His bedside manner is excellent and he makes sure he answers all of your questions thoroughly. I would recommend Dr. LeBlanc to anyone looking for a new doctor who really cares about your health and well being."
"Dr. Hunter is a very caring and professional doctor who is a valuable team player in the family practice sector of St. Joseph's General Hospital. She genuinely cares about her patients and is extremely thorough. Dr. Hunter listens and relates well to her patients."
"Dr. Hunter is very knowledgeable and takes the time to get to know her patients, unlike many other physicians. I've never had a long wait time before an appointment, and most times she is right on schedule. During appointments and exams, Dr. Hunter is very considerate and thorough. Both of my children and I see her regularly for check-ups, and we don't plan to change physicians any time soon."
"I saw Dr. Hunter in December of last year for a case of Pnuemonia, she did a wonderful job of listening to me explain to her that I always get Pnuemonia every year and she suggested that I get the Pnuemonia shot to keep this from reoccurring. She has been the first doctor to really listen to me, and answered my questions with no problems, she really took her time with me. She's been a great doctor for me. Highly recommend!"
"MY VISIT WITH DR.JABLONSKI WAS ABSOLUTELTY WONDERFUL. HE TOOK HIS TIME AND ANSWERED ALL OF MY QUESTIONS. HE WAS TOTALLY PROFESSIONAL, AND HE HAS A GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR.JABLONSKI!"
"Dr. Ted Jablonski, or "Dr. J" as he is sometimes called, is a true medical professional, employing his time and healing touch anywhere he can. Multi-talented, he lends his knowledge and ambition both with individuals in need of aid at nursing homes and sexual health consultations as well as behind the scenes through clinical trials. He is highly attentive to individual needs of patients, seeking to do all he can to help them sometimes searching even when other doctors have quit and is not afraid to admit that he doesn't have all the answers. He always puts his patients first. Dr. J is also one who leads by example, encouraging healthy lifestyles through fun activities he avidly participates in such as cycling and marathon running. Dr. Ted Jablonski truly is a miracle worker!"
"Ted Jablonski brings the phrase, 'More Than Medication,' to a bright light. His practice allows patients to bring forward their individual and specific needs, while he provides his vast knowledge to provide a holistic approach of healing and success. Dr. Jablonski is not your average doctor whom went to school for years for specified qualifications and became a doctor. He works in Nursing Homes while he is also trained in Sexual Health. He continues his education, while educating others throughout Canada. I give my highest acceptance and appreciation for Dr. Ted Jablonski's practice, as I have been given the most quality care and feel that I am actually being cared for while in his presence. "
"When I first met Dr. Jablonski, I was very unsure about what to expect for my family. I was scared at the idea of a new doctor that may not understand my personal needs or the needs of my children. But, he made me feel right at home, like I was visiting with a neighbor. He helped me to feel comfortable with myself and take charge of a healthier, more positive lifestyle, and showed me ways that I can teach my children to be healthier, too. Dr. Jablonski helped me gain control of my daily stress and gain a true sense of wellness. We went over my eating and sleeping habits together, discussing what was healthy and conducive to my busy life at the same time. I have made some very giant steps towards leading a healthy lifestyle for myself and my family, and I have Dr. Ted Jablonski to thank for that!"
"Doctor Jablonski is one of the most professional and understanding physicians I have ever visited. I have been to doctors that will quickly look you over and hurriedly assign you a general prescription just so they can get on to the next patient. Dr. Jablonsky makes sure that every patient feels as though their needs are important. He listens to everything the patient has to say without ever losing patience. He is a very gentle man. I wish more doctors practiced medicine like he does."
"I couldn't be happier now that I've discovered "More than Medication" and the wonders of the information available! I have had a long history of struggling with stress and a lack of energy, to the point that I finally began consulting a doctor two years back after things became significantly more difficult following a life-altering family crisis. We've tried several treatments, including medications, and I've seen therapists and psychologists. Though some things have helped, I never felt as if I was in control of the issue myself. "More than Medication" has aided greatly by giving me a great source for my own research and readily available support groups. While still working with my therapists, this site has given me another source of help. Dr. Jablonski is the very reason I have been introduced to these new programs and outlets to assist in alleviating my anxieties. Thank you, Dr. J!"
"I have been seeing my doctor Ted Jablonski for a little over a year now, and I enjoy my appointment times. I always can get in to see him in a timely matter, he ansewrs all of my questions, and always asks me my opinion on new medications, or certain treatments. I feel like a real person and not just a number with him. I appreciate the fact that he knows i know my body. He's a great doctor, i reccommend him to anyone, and i will continue with him as well."
"Dr. LeBlanc provided great service, with very little wait time. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist upon arrival and asked to fill out my paperwork. I was then taken to a patient waiting room within 5 minutes of returning my paperwork. Dr. LeBlanc came in within 5 minutes and took his time with me. He answered all of my questions, addressed my concerns and discussed what kind of results I could expect. He was thorough, respectful, and put me at ease. I high recommend Dr. LeBlanc!"
"When I went to Dr. Tinus Wasserfall's practice last month, I was pleasantly surprised. The waiting room was very clean and neat. It was very appeasing to the eye. The receptionists were especially friendly and helpful. It was not very difficult to get an appointment with him, as it is with many family care doctors. When I got back to the care room, Dr. Wasserfall was very professional. He made sure that all my concerns were addressed and was very friendly. He even made an effort to connect with me as a person instead of just writing me off as a patient like many other doctors I have visited in the past. I would definitely recommend Dr. Wasserfall to anyone that is searching for a friendly, professional and overall wonderful family care doctor."
"Dr. Tinus Wasserfall (Vancouver BC) is an excellent physician with a great personality. He always seems unrushed during my visits to his office, taking the time to answer any of my questions. His office staff are always kind and considerate. Appointments are always on time, and he's never been one of those doctors who call you out of the waiting room within a few minutes of your scheduled appointment, only to make you sit in one of the exam rooms for half an hour."
"This Doctor had a nice clean facility, and was charming and well groomed. They took care of my every needs. I would definitely recommend this Doctor to any of my friends. "
"My experience with Dr. Wasserfall was absolutely fabulous. His demeanor and attitude were caring and helpful. He had a humor about him which helped ease any tension my family had about going to the doctor. Our youngest daughter had to get some vaccines and we were expecting a lot of tears, but Dr. Wasserfall was able to talk her through it (with the help of my wife and I, of course) and we left the office with tear-free MMR shots. I would recommend Dr. Wasserfall to ANYBODY!"
"I just moved to the area and was looking for a doctor to help me get rid of a terrible cough I'd had for weeks. A friend recommended Spectrum Health. Since they were in my insurance network and Dr. Wasserfall was accepting new patients, I decided to give them a try. Dr. Wasserfall turned out to be one of the kindest, most intelligent doctors I've ever been to. He took the time to listen carefully to all of my symptoms. After a thorough examination he recommended allergy medicine! I was so shocked; I've never suffered from allergies in my life. Turns out he was right and my cough went away almost instantly. Very glad that I stumbled on this practice. I will be sure to try Dr. Wasserfall again next time I'm sick (which I hope won't be for a long time). My only complaint about Spectrum Health is that their URL tries to open an email program instead of going to a website! "
"When I walk into the office, I was greeted with an unexpectedly warm smile and a how are you from the receptionist. I have a sincere talk with the receptionists and am quickly seen by Dr. Wasserful. He is informative and helpful, and tells me all my options and gives me an unbiased analysis of my options. I am treated quickly and out of the office in a jiffy. This is a great practice, with great service and consistent treatment. Thank You, Dr. wasserful."
"Doctor Tinus Wasserfall was a great doctor. My family and I went to him last week. He had a light touch and had a very calming voice. My young son really liked him because he talked about sports with my son. This made my son less nervous. My husband said he was the best doctor he had ever been to. I asked him about the lump that I had been feeling in the back of my throat and gave me multiple reasons why it was there. He gave me a medication which has helped the lump decrease in size. He even checked up on my a few days ago to make sure the medicine was working. This showed me that he cared a lot. As for the facilities, they were clean and colorful. Great for my son to ease his nerves. Doctor Wasserfall is a wonderful doctor and we will be back to see him again!"
"Dr. Tinus Wasserfall is an extraordinary doctor. He is professional and works with his extreme patience. Knowing how doctors are, many just try to rush you out of their offices but when I made an appointment with Dr. Tinus Wasserfall he talked to me in a very professional and patient matter. It didn't feel like he just wanted to get rid of me and go on to his next patient but really wanted to solve my hospitality needs. He diagnosed me and quickly solved the problem at hand. Very good doctor. Very flexible doctor on scheduling as well."
"I have been a patient of Dr. Wasserfall for several years now and have always found my problems addressed in a most professional manner. He is an excellent diagnostician and really cares about his patients. He is willing to go out of his way to make sure you receive the best possible care in a timely manner. It is easy to make an appointment, and even if you don't have one but really need to see him urgently, he will squeeze you in for a brief visit. I recommend this doctor highly to anyone looking for a general practitioner. "
"My family and I recently switched to Dr. Van Jaarsveldt's practice. What a great decision! His staff is courteous and professional, and do a great job of scheduling appointments in such a way that there is never a long wait to be seen by the doctor. They are also very helpful with insurance claims. The doctor is warm and friendly, and really takes the time to get to know his patients, which is so rare these days! He reviewed all the information taken by his nurse with me, and paid careful attention to all of my concerns about my health. He was never arrogant or condescending, and made me feel like a partner in my healthcare, rather than a bystander who should just do as she's told. If you're looking for a new doctor, call Dr. Van Jaarsveldt's office, you won't be diappointed!"
"I went into the carpedium clinic under dr blanc to get facial surgery. I did not like the way that my nose was shaped. I say horror stories on television such as mr. jackson where plastic surgery made people even uglier. However, mr. blancs surgery helped me to look much better. He turned my nose from a beaky to a straight one. unlike other plastic surgeons, who try to tell me what to do dr blanc allowed me to say how I thought it should be done. I think that was one of the main reasons for sucess... the considerate nature of the doctor. "
"My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Van Jaarsveldt for years. We received good, thorough care. More importantly, we have never had to wait for more than fifteen minutes to be seen. The doctor is prompt. The long wait-time was the reason we left our previous clinic. The nurses here are friendly, and overall we are very pleased with the care we receive."
" When it comes to my family's health and well being, I trust the doctors at the Four Rivers Medical Clinic. Dr. Van Jaarsveldt is a well qualified member of the staff that I recently saw during my latest check-up visit. A very knowledgeable and friendly gentleman, Desmond Van Jaarsveldt is a excellent source of medical advice and easy to talk to. His warm, friendly nature makes you comfortable in his office, and he seems genuinely concerned for my family's well being. I recommend him to anyone looking for a good family medicine practitioner. "
"Dr. Desmond Van Jaarsveldt provides and excellent experience for my wife and I when visiting the office. We have been able to come in for office visits even when we were unable to make an appointment! The staff is very fast and friendly. -Mr. Tom Jones"
"I had finally given up my search for a good doctor when I found Dr. Van Jaaraveldt. Practicing with the Lakewood Family Practice Center, I was able to get a quick appointment, and knew upon speaking with the receptionist I had found someone I was going to love. And I was right. This doctor, and his staff,are absolutely amazing. I did not have to wait one minue to see the doctor, and he was so professional and friendly. He took the time to answer all of my questions and seemed so eager to help me get better. There aren't a lot of doctors like that anymore. I feel comfortable and content with the doctor and his staff, as if I am the only patient in the office. It felt like sitting with old friends instead of at the doctor office. I also love the fact I was able to get an appointment so quickly, and the no wait. I have finally found the doctor of my dreams, and I am never going anywhere else again. "
"Dr. Desmond VanJaarsveldt has been a valued member of this medical community for many years. I have trusted him to provide medical care for my entire family, from the youngest child to my elderly parents. He is always professional and courteous and he never seems to mind taking the extra time to explain something I don't understand. He will make house calls if we are too sick to drive to the office but if we are at the office, he makes sure to remind us that the pharmacy which is part of their practice can fill our prescriptions quickly. I like that we don't have to drive all over town to have it filled. One other good point about this doctor and Four Rivers Medical practice is that they have extended hours, starting very early in the morning until late in the evening; in addition, they have a walk-in clinic for emergencies. I don't think I would trust a new graduate doctor with the health of my family anywhere near as much as I trust Dr. Van Jaarsveldt. He makes us feel as though he truly cares about us."
"My 11 year old son had a fever, and cough that was keeping him up all night. I took him to see Dr. Desmond Van Jaarsveldt at Four Rivers Medical Group. While children are always getting sick, it is still every parent's nightmare and the worry and stress that something might really be wrong this time, always weighs on one's heart. Dr. Van Jaarsveldt was able to make me and my son feel at easy with his professional manner and confidence. It wasn't a big deal, but sometimes, you just need to feel sure that everything is ok. Thank you Dr. Van Jaarsveldt."
"Doctor Van Jaarsveldt of Four Rivers Medical Clinic was phenomenal. He looked at my son's swollen knee and was immediately able to treat the issue. He said that the bruise was nothing more than the result of a bike fall. (We assumed this, but we worried it was worse, for the bruise was so large). Dr. Jaarsveldt provided us with fast and simple coverage. He made sure we had all of our questions answered. Four Rivers Medical Clinic is the place to go if you want fast, affordable, and easy answers to your medical problems."
"Dr Jaarsveldt is a consummate professional. He has been an excellent doctor for me and my family, and was always up front about my various options/treatments. He is one of those doctors that actually takes time with you, listens and shows that he cares about you as a patient. I can't tell you how rare that is these days. It is clear that he loves what he does and it shows in his attitude. My daughter came to him with a specific, and weird, symptom. Dr. Jaarsveldt not only spent the week consulting with other doctors about it, but called us at home after hours to check up on her. She is totally fine now, thanks to him. I definitely recommend this doctor!"
"I went to see Dr. Jaarsveldt as a new patient. I had a really bad cold, so I called and was scheduled an appointment for the following morning. I arrived at ontime and was recieved by a very friendly front desk secretary. She gave me a form to fill out, and I was seen by the doctor on time, only waiting for a few minutes. Dr. Jaarsveldt listened to my symptoms and showed concern. He really cared about my needs. I would recommend any of my friends and family to his practice. He is a great doctor, and has a very clean facility. The practice has convenient office hours and it also accepts a variety of payments. "
"I am a new patient of Dr. Healley and my first experience with him was amazing. I was referred to him by a good friend and I saw him for the first time when I got a bad case of the flu. When I arrived he called my name right on time, something I've never experienced with any kind of medical appointment. I found him to be attentive, knowledgeable, and caring. I could tell he truly wanted to help and he went out of his way to share a tips to get through this flu as comfortably as possible. Finally! A doctor who listened!"
"I have one word for Dr. LeBlanc; AMAZING! He is extremely professional, very competent, and has great interpersonal skills. He explained all the pros and cons associated with my procedure so that I could make an informed decision. My procedure was a huge success and I was very pleased with Dr. LeBlanc follow up care!! He is the best!"
"I have been a patient of Dr Healley for over 6 years and I have always found him to be an excellent physician. He has an in depth knowledge of my particular medical condition and has treated it very successfully during the time I have been a patient. I can't recommend Dr Heally highly enough. "
"I had just moved to Calgary and I realized after I was done unpacking that there was something wrong with my ear. I didn't know anyone in the area so I chose Dr. Healley because his office was the most convenient for me. His receptionist was kind and courteous and scheduled an appointment the next day. While I was on my way to the appointment my boss called and said she needed back at the office to woo a new client. When Dr. Healley saw me I explained my situation and he was very sympathetic and professional. Other doctors that have treated me would have been irritated that I was in a rush but Dr. Healley was very gracious. He checked my ear told me I need antibiotics and said we could do a full physical another time. I was out the door within five minutes. All in all I feel that it was a real stroke of good luck that Dr. Healley is now my doctor."
"Dr. William Healley, a physician in the South Calgary Primary Care Network, is an excellent health care provider because of his passion for medicine and dedication to his patients.

He always provides the patient with extra education materials and recommends second opinions because your health is his top priority. "
"I went to the office of Doctor Healley on March 15 for my annual female checkup. I must say, I have never, ever felt so comfortable as i was with this doctor. From the moment he walked into the patient room and introduced himself i felt a calm feeling. He was very gentle and reassuring during my entire exam. In my opinion, all doctors need to have the same bedside manners as this guy! Absolutely amazing! I am keeping him as my doctor!"
"William Headleys' practice at South Calgary, AB is a well known and fastly growing organization. With the latest modern technology, William Headley and his team are well equipped to focus on your health in a very broad range of areas. These areas rang from primary health, to metal health, to chronic disease. The team at South Calgary also has a brillient goal to help educate the community of disease prevention. By doing this not only is William Headly encouraging a healthy community, but also a healthy world as other doctors follow his path. I recommend becoming a patient of Doctor Headly if you are looking for very knowledgable doctors that work hard every day to make the world a healthy place."
"I started seeing Dr. William Healley in the Primary Care Network as my behavioral health consultant after a friend advised me of his superior health care. I have had uncontrolled panic attacks for a number of years and no doctors that I have seen in the past have seemed to be able to help and many of them seemed to just not care about the horrible effects panic attacks were having on my life. Dr. William Healley seemed to know the illness and it's causes very well and determined that I suffered from bipolar disorder and changed my treatment and I have been free from panic attacks for more than two years now. I cannot say enough to urge you to see Dr. Healley if you suffer as I did from panic or anxiety disorder. Thanks to Dr. Healley I have my life back now. "
"Dr. William Healley is one of the best doctors around. He is very knowledgeable and always eager to answer any questions that may arise from his patients. His practice, The South Calgary Primary Care Network, is fully equipped with the best technologies and equipment. The staff is always there to help and is always courteous and polite. You can't find a better doctor, or practice, anywhere else! "
"Dr. Healley has been my families primary care physician for many years. Caring for all 5 members of our family Dr. Healley and his staff have become like family. We never have to wait very long at our appointments. His office is always clean, warm, and comfortable. Dr. Healley is always up beat and friendly and conservative with his prescription writing. He's been a wonderful doctor for my family for many years and will continue to be so for many to come."
"I highly recommend Dr. Howley. He has integrity, is very honest and friendly. He is a responsible doctor who likes to take care of his patients and gets his job done properly. Every single time I have had the pleasure of seeing him, he has remained consistent, patient-focused and approachable. His staff and facility are also both exceptional. I would absolutely recommend him in the highest regard to anyone on the look out for a caring, reputable surgeon. In fact, I have already sent several of my friends and my family members his way! He is truly a blessing."
"I simply do not have enough good things to say about Dr. Howley. He completely changed how I few myself when he gave me my new nose. I am no longer embarrassed by the huge beak I used to have, instead I have the perfect nose to fit my face. Everyone that he works with are extremely nice and professional and I never once had any misgivings about him. I met with a few other surgeons before my operation, and none of them were as nice or as helpful as Dr. Brent Howley. "
"Dr. Brent Howley is very kind and attentive. He is very knowledgable in the medical field and helpful when it comes to approaching him for advice. He saw my son right away when he was really sick, even though i did not have an appointment, which I really appreciated. He's always very thorough when diagnosing, which is great because some doctors out there don't care enough to take the time to really understand what is going on and prescribe something that won't help the condition."
"The visit was wonderful. Stuff that were assign the day I went were very accessible. Polite and respect were given at all steps of the process. I would recommend it to my friends. The sense of belonging was indeed met."
"I went in to see Dr. Aboolian after a friend recommended him for his bedside manner. I initially went to see Dr. Aboolian just to get a consultation for a mini face lift. The girls at the front desk were very welcoming and even remembered my name. I was promptly taken to a consultation room and only minutes later Dr. Aboolian arrived. Unlike most doctors, he did not seem overwhelmed or rush the consultation. He took time to answer all my questions thoroughly and made me feel at ease while keeping a professional demeanor. After he was informed of what I was looking for and an examination, he told me that he did not feel that I needed a mini face lift that he would recommend a dermapeel instead. I found this very enlightening because even though he would have made more money off of the procedure I came in for, he put that aside and was honest with me. I will only go to Dr. Aboolian for any further procedures I may need. He really made me feel important."
"Doctor Brent Howley is a top-notch cosmetic surgeon and it was my pleasure to have been one of his patients. Doctor Brent took the time to listen to my expectations of the results I wanted to achieve through cosmetic surgery. He was courteous and professional in answering my questions regarding the surgery, and really took the time to make me feel comfortable when discussing the procedure and outcome with me. He explained the things I should expect during the surgery in a clear, concise manner and made me feel at ease while he discussed possible complications and how he would handle them. I left my consultation feeling very comfortable and prepared for my surgery. During and after my surgery, Doctor Brent was continually knowledgeable, professional and comforting. He made everything seem like a breeze and really put my mind at ease. My recovery was a cinch, and I am extremely pleased with the results I received. Doctor Brent changed my life with his professional knowledge and expertise in the field of cosmetic surgery! I have so much confidence and self-esteem and I really feel like a new woman. I would definitely go to Doctor Brent again, and will be recommending him to my friends and family."
"I can't describe the amazing care I received with Dr. Howley. His staff was friendly and understanding and the Dr. himself was gentle and caring.I will not be needing another physician anytime soon."
"Dr. Brent Howley and his staff made my experience with a breast reduction surgery a positive one. From my initial visit I felt that Dr. Howley and his associates had my best interests in mind, and they took the time necessary to answer all of my questions and alleviate concerns. As this was a medically recommended procedure, they obtained coverage and out-of-pocket cost information for me prior to scheduling the procedure, and helped to obtain financing to cover the portion of the expense I was responsible. On the day of the procedure I was treated with care and respect every step of the way. The nurse called me at home that evening several hours after I was released, and then again the following day, to be sure that everything was going well in the initial stages of recovery and to answer any additional questions I had before my one week post-op visit. I only wish I had done the surgery sooner! It has now been 3 months, and the difference it has made in my every day life is amazing. I am no longer self conscious in my clothes, or have back and shoulder pain that left me on constant pain medication and dealing with unpleasant side effects. The incisions are healing beautifully, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. I would definitely recommend this practice to others for whatever procedure they may be considering."
"Dr. Brent Howley has had over five years experience working as a plastic, cosmetic, and reconstructive surgeon. He takes the time to get to know each patient personally. Dr. Howley makes sure he really understands exactly what you desire before going forward with any operations. He attended St. Francis Xavier University for his undergraduate degree and went on to attend medical school at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. When he graduated, he received many honors including the high honor of Silver D for stellar performance. Dr. Howley is fully licensed and certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Patient safety is his primary concern. Payment plans are easy to understand and simple to obtain. Dr. Brent Howley ensures you will love the way you look, from head to toe."
"I would like to commend Dr Brent Howley and his staff for the great assistance they gave me on getting Botox treatment, Dr Howley and his staff are wonderful and answered all my concerns,since this was the first time that I was having Botox treatment, the procedure was very simple and only took about 30 minutes, the Dr and staff were very informative and kind. I love the way botox made me look and feel so much better about myself and will soon be going back for some dermal fillers. "
"When I first started looking for a cosmetic surgeon I visited a lot of doctor's offices looking for the right fit for me and I found Dr. Burke Robinson's office to be the most supportive and professional choice. I didn't really know what I wanted at the time, just that I wanted to look younger, and the staff there were so helpful in explaining what options I had and what surgeries they offered that I made the decision to get a facelift that very day. Once I had decided what to get, they put me at ease with the process and introduced me to Dr. Robinson. Dr. Robinson was very knowledgeable and explained everything step by step to me so that I knew what to expect. They also had great financing options as well so it made it very easy for me to pay in installments. After it was all said and done, he did a fantastic job on my face, making me look years younger. There really is no question in my mind where I would go if I need further work done in the future and I now tell all my friends considering getting a facelift to go to Dr. Robinson!"
"I went to see Dr. Robinson. First of all making an appointment was simple and I got in within a week of calling. The office was clean, organized and the office staff was very friendly, accomodating and professional. I felt right at home. The new patient paperwork was thorough but not redundant and was easy to navigate through. I had approximately a ten minute wait time before being seen. The nurse was friendly and immediately made me feel comfortable. She had a good sense of humor and was very likeable. I waited approximately 5 minutes between seeing the nurse and the doctor. Dr. Robinson had excellent bedside manner. He explained my options in depth in a language I could easily understand. He took his time to answer my questions thoroughly and didn't pressure me in any way. He was respectful of my wishes and allowed me to choose the course of my treatment. I would definately recommend Dr. Robinson. "
"I've used Dr. Burke P. Robinson as my primary care physician for two years and have received excellent care. I have multiple health conditions, and one (acid reflux) makes it difficult to treat anything else, as a lot of ordinary medications mess up my stomach. He's done a great job managing all of it and is as personable as he is knowledgeable. Dr. Burke P. Robinson spends a lot of time answering questions, and although he is very tightly scheduled, will always make room for a sick or injured patient. He is also generally quite punctual. He also has filled out various forms for work and sports quickly. Five stars for his treatment. Dr. Burke P. Robinson genuinely is accepting new patients at the moment -- He's so well liked that her current patients keep referring new ones, which is how I found him in the first place. I have PPO insurance and it's never been an issue. His practice gets another star because of the staff -- I've had excellent experiences. The staff has always been courteous, though, and one of hisr staff has done a bunch of wrangling with my insurance company and mail-in pharmacy to get me my medication. "
"I had been unhappy with the texture of my facial skin for a couple of years. I also was self-conscious about some uneven pigmentation and spotting that I had developed from sun exposure over the years. I am in my 40s and in great shape, my face just looked older than I felt. I found Dr. Robinson through the American Board of Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. My primary care physician had told me the most important thing to look for when searching for a plastic surgeon is to make certain they are Board Certified in plastic surgery. I was very nervous when I went to my appointment, but Dr. Robinson quickly put me at ease once he came into the exam room. He looked at the areas on my face that bothered me and suggested a Laser Skin Resurfacing treatment, which he would be able to perform in his office. We discussed what the procedure would entail, and also what recovery would be like and what results I could realistically expect. I agreed that this course of treatment would best suit my needs and then met with the office manager to make my appointment and go over payment options. I returned a week later for my Laser Skin Resurfacing and the procedure was a bit uncomfortable, but not at all painful. I received numbing injections before the treatment and honestly that was the worst part. During the recovery period, I made certain to follow all of the post-procedure instructions exactly and at 10 weeks post-procedure, I am so pleased with my results. My skin is smoother, brighter and has an overall fresh look. I am very satisfied with the care I received from Dr. Robinson and plan to return to him in a few weeks to discuss facial filler injections. "
"I have had two procedures done by Dr. Burke P. Robinson and both times I have been treated with dignity and respect by both the surgeon and staff. I was quite uncomfortable with the thought of having cosmetic surgery, but felt it was time to finally make some changes that I have wanted to make since I was a teenager. Professional, caring and willing to listen to all my concerns, Dr. Robinson made me feel at ease and took great care of me. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Burke P. Robinson to anyone who is seeking cosmetic surgery."
"I was hesitate about seeking a cosmetic surgeon because I was worried about cost, recovery time and risks. Dr Aboolian and his staff immediately set my mind at ease. They thoroughly explained the facelift procedure and layed out everything from pricing to the surgery itself to the recovery process. Best of all, they kept in contact with me after the surgery to make sure everything was going as expected. I am absolutely thrilled with the results and would recommend Dr Aboolian to anyone!"
"Robinson Facial Plastic Surgery is a great place. When you first walk in, the waiting room is very homey and comfortable. It made me feel at ease. When I met Dr. Robinson himself, he seemed nice and relaxed. It was easy to talk to him about the procedure I wanted. He also had plenty of before-and-after shots so I could see the kind of work he did. He explained the what the procedure would be like very clearly, and when I didn't understand something, he was able to answer all my questions. Overall, I left feeling really good about myself and I couldn't wait to get started. If you are considering any facial plastic surgery, I highly recommend going here!"
"Having spent most of my adolescent years completely covered from head to toe regardless of the season, weather or temperature, I am so relieved to finally look in the mirror and see me - and not the ugly scars left behind by acne. Dr. Robinson and the entire office staff have truly given me back a freedom I have not experienced since before I was a teenager. What an amazing feeling to walk out of the house, confident I look my best because I feel my best. No more excruciating hours in the mirror trying to "cover-up". No more shopping for just the right clothing to conceal the acne damage. I can't begin to express how grateful I am for Dr. Robinson's talents. Thank you, thank you, thank you! You have changed my life. I want to share my story with others in hopes that they too can experience the new opportunities your treatment has offered me."
"Dr. Burke P. Robinson is an expert. When it comes to changing your face, he knows what he's doing. He is friendly and approachable, making the experience much more positive. He addressed every concern I had with in-dept information that really helped me through this process. His personable nature and extreme expertise in the plastic surgery field convinced me to return to Dr. Robinson for any future work I need done. Overall, a great doctor who made my experience as pleasant as it could be."
"I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Robinson just to get some Botox done on my face and they were able to get me in to be seen that same week. I had never had Botox before, but Dr. Robinson was very helpful with making me understand the entire process. I was very pleased with the results and received a couple follow-up calls just to make sure that everything was going alright for me. Very helpful office staff and an all-around great experience for me. I would highly recommend Dr. Robinson."
"I recently visited Dr. Burke P. Robinson for treatment. From the time I entered the practice I immediately felt the ambiance of a highly professional environment. My nerves were calmed by the tender care and precision of the staff. Following the procedure, my expectations of the results were exceeded. If you are thinking about having a procedure done, I would highly recommend Dr. Robinson as my physician of choice. "
"We just wanted to thank the staff of SickKids for all of their wonderful support throughout our stay with them. Although this was a very stressful time for us, everyone at SickKids treated us so well and were very helpful in answering all of our questions and concerns. We are so thankful to Dr. Christopher Forrest and his assistants! They really took the time to explain everything with the procedure and provided the reassurance we needed during this time. All of our accomodations and the excellent support from the staff members made our experience so much easier and we were able to provide our son with the family support he needed. I can't thank you enough for everything that you have done for us! We highly recommend SickKids to any parent who may be considering having their child's procedure here; the staff is extremely helpful and supportive."
"Dr. forrest is a fantastic pediatritian. He goes out of his way to make it fun for the kids and be their friends. He is very through in eliminating every possible way my son was feeling ill to determine the reason, and make sure it wasnt anything serious. Dr. Forrest is the kind of doctor that remembers the name of you and your family without having to look at a chart. He is a shining example of what a doctor should be and an honor to the profession."
"I need to have some cosmetic Surgery done, however hearing horror stories I was a bit nervous. I went into Dr. Forrest's office and all of my nervousness was put at ease. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean, and Dr. Chris (as I like to call him) was very detailed; he went over everything with me. I recommend this place to anyone looking for an excellent Surgeon. I will be going back also I have referred my 2 best friends and a co-worker; they all have rave reviews."
"I've had a badly broken nose since the days I was young and wild. I always told myself I would get it fixed when I had some money. But I didn't really know about cosmetic surgery. One of my wife's friends suggested Dr. Forrest, so I made an appointment to see what could be done. Dr. Forrest was very thorough and explained all about the procedure and answered all my questions without acting rushed or put-upon, so I booked the surgery. He had told me I might look like I'd gotten my eyes blackened, but he did an amazing job. There was no bruising and only a little swelling. I don't know that I'll ever need plastic surgery again, but if I did, I would come right back to Dr. Forrest, and I'd recommend him to anyone who asked."
" Dr.Christopher Forrest is one of our best pediatric surgeons at the Sick Kids hospital. He performs all kinds of surgeries, from tumor removal to plastic and cosmetic surgeries. He's been doing successful surgeries for an exceptional amount of years and it shows in his work and in the way he cares for his patients. Dr.Forrest works very well with the children. He will do whatever he can to make sure that each of his patients is comfortable before and after surgery. If your in need of a execllent pediatric surgeon ,look for Dr. Christopher Forrest of Sick Kids hospital."
"Dr Andre Aboolian is a truly amazing doctor who places the needs and well being of his patients first. Dr Aboolian offers heartfelt advice and encouragement throughout the consultation, procedure, and during recovery. The result of my surgery are amazing and I have referred several friends who all have nothing but positive things to say. He truly values his work and his patients privacy and confidentiality. I truly recommend Dr Andre Aboolian to anyone considering a cosmetic procedure."
"Christopher Forrest is possibly one of the best physicians I have ever met! His care for his patients could only be outdone by his incredible personality. I look foward to return to his care in the future."
"Our daughter was born with a cleft palate. Dr. Forrest and the SIck Kids Foundation were recommended by our family practitioner. Dr. Forrest reassured us and outlined the entire treatment plan. He oversaw the procedure and provided clear step by step recovery instructions. He and his staff gave our whole family great attention during this ordeal. We are truly grateful."
"Dr. Forrest is an exceptional pediatric plastic surgeon. I simply cannot say enough about the quality of his care and degree of professionalism. He is highly experienced in his field, and his level of expertise quickly puts his patients and their families at ease. While being highly professional, he is also incredibly down-to-earth and patient. He takes the time to answer questions and provide information in a compassionate manner. His work truly speaks for himself, and the results far exceeded our expectations. He is highly regarded in his field, and for good reason."
"This review is regarding a Botox procedure at lakeview medical. I had been considering botox injections for a few years. I decided to drop by one day because I live in the area and would pass by the location. I'd never had any kind of cosmetic procedure before so I was a little nervous going in how it would work. Dr. Nave made my experience very pleasant, however. She explained the procedure to me in plain english and didn't make me feel uncomfortable whatsoever. It was quick, it was painless, and I am looking forward to my next appointment. I saw the results right away. Forehead wrinkles no more! I'm so grateful to Dr. Nave for helping me through my first experience with botox. Before I had always regarded it as unpleasant and not worth the money, but now that I've experienced it for myself and it was worth it! "
"When I first walked into the office of Dr. Cynthia Nave I instantly felt welcome. The warm inviting atmosphere, and the super friendly receptionist made me feel like I had made the right choice by coming to this office. I was going in only for a simple botox injection in my lips. They set me up an appointment within a reasonable amount of time, and took care of my as if I was going there for many years, even though I was a new patient. I was also extremely happy with the results of the botox, she provided more than outstanding services. I highly recommend going to Dr. Cynthia Nave's office, I know that going to a new place can be difficult especially if you are unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the doctor, but she made my experience easier."
"Dr. Nave is a very kind, open, and welcoming doctor. She puts me at ease the moment I walk through her door. She understands my motivation for having this type of work (Botox, body contouring, etc.) done and is so willing to work with me to get the results I want!"
"Dr. Cynthia Nave is one of the best doctors I have been to for my botox injections. Other doctors are too rough and do not take time to get to know their patients. Dr. Nave always takes the time during each appointment to ask you about yourself, and what brought you to her office. She also takes the time to learn something about your personal life, in order to ensure that she is providing you with all of the services that you need or didn't realize you needed. I will definitely be returning to Dr. Nave's office in the future, and I will definitely recommend her as well as her practice to all of my friends!"
"Before going to Lake View Medical Clinic and ending up in the wonderful hands of Dr. Cynthia Nave I suffered chronic migraines that were often times debilitating. Now, after undergoing a few botox injection sessions I can safely say I live a life free from the horrendous pain that they would often cause me. The staff were also incredibly friendly and help; both over the phone and in person. Thank you Dr. Cynthia! "
"I have been going to Dr. Nave for many years now. She is the best family doctor I have ever had. She really takes the time to listen to my concerns and make a proper diagnosis. She is not afraid to ask for a consult if she needs one. Her office is always busy but the staff there are very professional and wait times are short. There is no gossip among the staff members and I've only ever heard them say nice things about Dr. Nave. She answered all my questions about the Botox procedure I was considering and yet I didn't feel pressured to do it in any way. She helped me make an informed decision about what was right for me. I truly felt like she cared about me as a person and didn't just see me as a dollar sign. Very clean facility too!"
"Recently, I had been looking for an expert doctor for some work that I have been looking to get done for while. I met what felt like dozens until I found Dr. Cynthia Nave. An expert in her field, she made me feel at home from the moment I walked into her office. I had the UltraShape procedure done and was so satisfied with it that I went back for some BOTOX work around my brow and smile lines. Dr. Nave is a wonderful woman and an even more wonderful doctor. I would recommend anyone in the area and those who are even relatively close to the surrounding area's to go visit her about anything they offer that you have been considering. I guarantee that if you weren't sure before hand you will be after the meet."
"Dr. Aboolian is a miracle worker, he has given me the power to redeem my self esteem. I was in a terrible automobile accident 2 years ago, and was left with signficant scaring on the left side of my face. Dr. Aboolian was recommended by my primary care physician after all other injuries had healed. During my initial consultation; Dr.Aboolian, put my fears to rest; I would not be disfigured for life. He was upfront and honest with me; I would need to undergo several surgeries and there would be brusing and swelling after each. He has rebuilt my nose and jaw line, grafted new skin on my left check, and repaired a prior facial scar. I look better than my old self again. Dr. Aboolian is my savior. I recommend him and his staff to anyone needing considerable cosmetic repair, or just a nip here and a tuck there. "
"Dr. Cynthia Nave has no competition, in my mind, when it comes to cosmetic surgery in the Saskatoon area. I went to her a few months back from Botox treatment and for liposuction. Her staff could not have been more supportive and courteous, as well as Dr. Nave. The liposuction was actually a non-invasive procedure and the Botox turned out great! If you're looking for a cosmetic surgeon and want one that is professional, kind, and knowledgable, look no further than Dr. Cynthia Nave at Lake View Medical Clinic. "
"Dr. Nave was a pleasure to have as my physician. She was very professional and understanding, and was able to answer any questions I had about the process. I received a botox injection, and the surgery site healed very quickly and safely. I would definitely recommend Dr. Nave to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery. She is very knowledgeable, undestanding, and professional."
"Dr. Cynthia Nave at Lakeview Medical Clinic is an outstanding listener. She really takes the time to hear your concerns and answer any questions you may have. She is very easy to talk to and she makes the time to cover everything you want or need to know. Her professionalism is beyond reproach and she will help calm any fears you may have."
"When I first decided to get body contouring, I knew that wanted to see Dr. Taranow. He has been recommended to me by numerous friends for his breast augmentation and body contouring work. Initially I checked out his website, I was able to look through numerous galleries to see more examples of his work. I decided to set my appointment for a liposuction, and I was very pleased with the outcome. His office and staff were very inviting, and he seemed to be very knowledgeable about the procedure. The surgery went very well. I have now fully recovered and I look great! I would definitely recommend Dr. Taranow to anyone looking for a great plastic surgeon. "
"I made an appointment with Dr. Taranow at the suggestion of my orthopedist. I had very large breasts - 32DDD - and I had quite a great deal of pain in my back and shoulders, and recurrent numbness in my arms. After years of ortopedic and chiroprctic treatment, my orthopedist finally suggested that my large breasts might be the problem, and he referred me to Dr. Taranow. At my first appointment, I was embarrassed, but Dr. Taranow made me feel comfortable and the exam was not nearly as awkward as I expected it to be. Dr. Taranow concurred with my orthopedist that my breasts were causing my pain and numbness, and we decided on an "after" size, and scheduled an appointment for the surgery two weeks later. I am now a couple of months post surgery and I could not be happier. I came home the day after surgery, and my recovery was fairly uneventful. All of the stitches were internal and dissolvable so I didn't have to go back to have stitches removed, but Dr. Taranow did ask me to come back a couple of times so he could check on my progress. The scars are healing nicely, and are mostly hidden, and I am loving my new 32C breasts. The back and shoulder pain and the numbness are gone, and now I can wear the cute little tops that I never could wear before. I think Dr. Taranow did an amazing job with my surgery, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. "
"For most of my adult life, I've had self confidence and body-image issues. About six months ago, a friend suggested I make an appointment with Dr. Douglas Taranow. I was nervous; the idea of getting cosmetic surgery seemed extreme and I wasn't sure I was prepared to risk something going wrong. Dr. Taranow put my mind at ease. He had an answer for every one of my questions, and after hearing him explain how low the risks actually were, I was ready to set an appointment for breast augmentation surgery. Now I have amazing confidence that I only dreamed of before. Dr. Taranow did an incredible job, I don't even have any scars from the surgery! This procedure really changed my life and I wholeheartedly recommend him if you're considering getting cosmetic surgery."
"This doctor is an amazing at what he does. My wife had liposuction done by this doctor and he did an amazing job. It was easy to schedule time with him and he paid full attention to every detail we discussed at our appointment. Staff at this place is very helpful which is also another plus point about this doctor and how he does business. Thanks!"
"I normally do not write recommendations however after going to Dr. Tarnows office I felt compelled to write one. His staff is second to none. They made me feel comfortable with the procedure I was having done. Dr. Taranow's bedside manner coupled with his expertise in cosmetic surgery allowed me to be at ease. The work Dr. Taranow performed was excellent and I would recommend him to everyone."
"Dr. Douglas A. Taranow should be near the top of anyone's list who is looking to have a cosmetic procedure performed. With his extensive background in general surgery and specialization treating burn victims Dr. Taranow has now made a reputation as one of NY's top plastic surgeons. I was amazed how little scarring was present after my procedure. Dr. Taranow seemed to really understand my process of healing after the procedure and kept me as comfortable and informed as possible at every step along the way. Definetely would recommend him to my friends and family!!"
"Dr. Taranov was absolutely wonderful! He and his staff are efficient, knowledgeable and friendly. Dr. Taranov makes me feel as though I truly am important, and remembers many things that we have talked about, which shows that he respects me as a client, as well as a friend. He is very confident in his treatments, and I am as well, as I have had zero problems after any of his visits. I am a loyal customer and anticipate that I will remain one for life. "
"I am in my forties and I wanted to get some cosmetic work done on my face. I searched the internet for information and reviews on surgeons (I did not want to trust my face to just anyone). A lot of people said that they had a good experience with Andre Aboolian. I called and made an appointment and boy am I glad that I did. Andre was GREAT. I felt really comfortable and every question that I had was answered. The staff was top notch as well. I was nervous at first but the work that I had done turned out great. I look ten years younger! I would definitely recommend Andre Aboolian to my friends and family. "
"Dr. Douglas A. Taranow is a wonderful, compassionate surgeon. I was not surprised to see that he stays up-to-date on all relevant knowledge. Even though other doctors turned me away, I realized it was a blessing in disguise when I was finally referred to him. I am glad he was the doctor to operate on me, instead of the others I saw earlier. Even though my case was difficult, he did a great job and I love the way I look now. No one can tell that I had surgery unless they know exactly where to look for the tiny scars and examine my skin closely. If I ever (God forbid) get in another accident and need more cosmetic surgery, he's the only one I would hire."
"Eric Bensimon is one of the most helpful and kind doctors you could hope to get. I went in on january 3rd 2012 for a nose job. Here i am today, looking better than ever, and it's all thanks to this wonderful man. He helped me find exactly what would look the best on me and then he perfected it to look amazing."
"Best plastic surgeon in the USA! You will not be dissatisfied with his work. I was extremely pleased with my breast implants and rhinoplasty. You know he's a good surgeon when it doesn't take very long to heal. I would hands down recommend Dr. Bensimon to anyone who asked."
"Dr. Eric Bensimon is a very accomplished plastic surgeon. He is on the staff of Sacre-Coeur Hospital and he teaches at the University of Montreal, plastic surgery department. He has worked with Drs. Menard and Brassard since 2002, performing facial feminization surgery as well as plastic surgery and craniofacial surgery. He is an excellent doctor and has a wonderful bedside manner. I am very pleased with his work and would recommend him to anyone. He takes the time to listen to what your needs and concerns are."
"I actually do not know where to begin, doctor Bensimon helped me with a very hard situation. I had a car accident and I was badly injured, I was not to worry about my body because I knew those were not going to affect me too much but there were one in my face that was going to let a pretty ugly scar which I did not like. A friend told me about doctor Eric Bensimon, he told me these great things that I could not believe but once I met him I realized that my friend was not exaggerating, he was the most kind since the beginning, he explained me the whole proccess and calmed my nerves about the entire thing, actually he was very pacient because I asked him so many things and he took the time to answer me. Now after the surgery I look even better, no side effects or anything, it took me like two months for the surgery pain to disappear but I dont have to worry about an ugly scar on my face, doctro Bensimon selfdemanding excellence what proofed me that he is the best."
"Dr. Bensimon was great! I was really skeptical about getting any form of cosmetic surgery at first, but decided to get a consultation at the urging of a friend. Dr. Bensimon answered all my questions and didn't try to push my fears aside. By the time I finished speaking with him, I felt completely comfortable about the procedures and didn't feel like I was jumping into something I didn't understand. Dr. Bensimon was clearly knowledgeable about the subject and had a great bedside manner. Highly recommended for all your cosmetic surgery needs!"
"I recently underwent a rhinoplasty performed under the expert care of Dr. Eric Bensimon, after having lived with breathing problems for years after a broken nose that never healed properly. I was initially apprehensive about having such a procedure done, but after having my first consultation with Dr. Bensimon I knew I would be in good hands. Dr. Bensimon has a wonderful bedside manner to make his patients feel at ease, especially important to me when you're considering such a serious procedure as facial reconstructive surgery. And he has the knowledge and expertise to leave you feeling confident that you made the best choice. I never regretted for a moment that I chose Dr. Bensimon and the team at Montreal Plastic Surgery. "
"Dr Eric Bensimon was recommended to me by 2 of my friends. He was very professional and very caring at the same time. He provided me with fantastic advice to help me look younger and more vital without the fake overdone look. He suggested subtle changes that peeled back the years from my face. Even my husband, the skeptic, was amazed at the change but yet was unable to identify just what had been done. I would recommend Dr Bensimon to everyone! I Love my fresh younger look!"
"Doctor Eric Bensimon might be my favorite doctor ive been to. I saw him after i hurt my wrist and he quickly figured out that it was just sprained and not broken. He perscribed some pain pills and a 2 week session of therapy for it. My wrist now feels perfect. He was also very nice and curtious person. I would highly reccomend him. "
"I would highly recommend Dr. Eric Bensimon to anyone looking for a skilled and competent cosmetic surgeon. I had been getting Botox treatments for several months but was feeling lackluster about the results, so I decided to bite the bullet and get a facelift. Dr. Bensimon worked closely with me to make me well acquainted and comfortable with what the procedure would be like, so I was confident that he would do a good job. The results were fantastic- friends I hadn't seen in ages complimented me on how "refreshed" I looked without it being obvious that I had work done. Thank you to Dr. Bensimon and his wonderful staff!"
"Dr. Aboolian is a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon known nationwide for his appearances ABC's Extreme Makeover and NBC's The Biggest Loser. Dr. Aboolian specializes in breast augumentation, body and face lifts.If you prefer a non-surgical approach to age defying gravity then, Dr. Aboolian has injectabe enhancements like botox and juviderm or skin peel treatments that can erase years of sun damage off your skin while repairing the elasticity. I choose Dr. Aboolian for a rhinoplasty. This was my second rhinoplasty the first surgeon had difficuly with proper alignment and my nose did not heal correctly. Dr. Aboolian and his staff treated me very well knowing the stress I was under to have this surgery done a second time. My worries were gone when I was able to reveal the bandages and see the beautiful work that Dr. Aboolian. It was fantastic! I am no longer shy and self-conscientious f my appearance and I can't tell you how freeing that is! "
"I cannot say enough about Dr. Greyvenstein and his practice. He is a truly caring and knowledgeable and takes the time to listen during my appointment. I never feel rushed. The front desk and staff is very courtesous and I am seen right away. I would highly recommend Dr. Greyvenstein."
"With medical practice being as overburdened and hectic as it is today I was not expecting the level of care and attention that I received from Dr. Greyvenstein. Although it was obvious from the waiting area that the practice was quite busy the doctor took the time to slow down and address my concerns with patience. At no point did he seem harried or willing to just "get on to the next patient". He not only treated me like a person he did it with a smile. "
"I recently went in to see Doctor Greyvenstein. Overall, it was a very good visit. I arrived, and didn't have to wait to be checked in; I just talked to the receptionist, provided updated insurance information, and that was it. It was quick and easy. I then had to sit down and wait. But the waiting room was nice- it was quiet, peaceful, and well decorated. The chairs were comfortable, there were plenty of different magazines to read, and there weren't a lot of people there. Also good-I wasn't in the waiting room for very long. That's always the part that is the worst for me- when I get stuck in a waiting room for 30 minutes or more. But after only about 5 minutes, the nurse came through the door and asked me to come back. "
"Ernst Greyvenstein was amazing they really helped put me at ease in which made it much easier for me to talk about my condition with them. They are also very lively and talkative and made me tell you them as a friend just not as a doctor. I definitely plan on returning to Ernst's practice for any other medical care and need future because of the kind and caring attitudes towards me the patient. Which is especially helpful when you have is awkward condition as I did."
"It has been such a fantastic relief to have Dr. Ernst Greyvenstein as my family's doctor. Whenever one must search for a new doctor there is always the sinking feeling that all the "good ones" have already been taken. My family and I stopped worrying once we found Dr. Greyvenstein. He has an excellent and kind bedside manner that immediately helped us relax. He really listens to our concerns and is attentive enough to know when we're feeling apprehensive about something. He is willing to take the extra time to get to know a person and their personality before diagnosing their symptoms. We have never had an appointment delayed, and he makes a point of never making anyone wait alone in a room for long. I can honestly say I look forward to going to the doctor now. I feel like I am being looked after. It's nice to feel as if someone is putting my needs and my health first, and their time and their money second. I recommend Dr. Greyvenstein to all my friends and family all the time."
"Dr Greyvenstein was able to see me as a same day appointment. I had woken up with a strange rash on my chest and needed it checked out. He was very caring and listened to all my concerns. He was also very thorough in his diagnosis and took the time to make sure he was providing the right medication and understood what type of rash I had. He explained everything to me in detail and did not leave untill I fully understood what I needed to do when I got home for treatment. I was really impressed with Dr Greyvenstein. I will definitely be seeing him again and suggest you do as well!"
"After going through a series of health related issues,And getting no help. The people at South Calgary Primary Care Network were able to find the problem and and get me results. Their staff was very pleasant and helped with every aspect . They were also really helpful with the insurance process. Now I'm back on my feet and healthy . Thanks South Calgary Primary care !!"
"Doctor Ernst Greyvenstein is an amazing physician. He actually cares about his patients and tries his very best to help in every way he can. He listens very well and I would trust any advice he gives me. I am extremely happy with this doctor and refuse to see any other physician."
"Dr.Greyvenstein's practice is at Circle Medical. He is a very good doctor. He runs his practice with the utmost care. Dr.Greyvenstein was very attentive to my needs. He tries to make sure he was enough time to answer your questions.He is also not rude when talking to you. Despite having many patients the day I came in, he sat aside enough time so he could answer my questions directly. I did not have to spend a lot of time with a nurse or medical assistant; Dr.Greyvenstein attended to me within ten minutes of me going to the examination room. I highly recommend Dr.Greyvenstein and his practice if you are looking for a great primary care practitioner. "
"After having twins, my varicose veins were really visible and ugly, I'm only in my twenties and had to wear heavy stockings to cover them, even in the summertime. I made an appointment and went to go see Dr. Luna, because a friend said he helped her mom. I was really nervous that the injections would hurt, but they didn't! Dr. Luna was very kind, professional and answered all of my questions. Several treatments later, I'm out of my stockings and hope to be wearing shorts again this summer. I highly recommend Dr. Luna to anyone suffering from ugly veins that make you ashamed to be seen in public."
"I was particularly disappointed with the interactions of the reception staff, from a cold welcome at check-in to when I asked if they had valet parking they responded rudely that they did not and did not tell me the alternative. As a HHonors Gold member who travels on business frequently, I was more than disappointed by the performance of the staff at this property, as I know the Hilton brand expects and serves at better standards.For what you will pay here, being one of the more expensive options in the Ithaca area, the hotel is rundown and needs a renovation. The sheets and amenities were ratty and outdated. The TV's basic channel options were underwhelming, and the wifi was some of the slowest I have ever seen, not even worth using it. To top it all off, I was placed in a non-smoking room that someone had clearly smoked in, but there were only "smoking" rooms available for me to move to, so I put up with it. We only stayed one night at this hotel but we were not sorry to leave.  The welcome by the bellman and reception staff was basic and not friendly.  The concierge made every effort to be helpful and was the most friendly of the staff.  The "free" breakfast was very basic, the only alternative seemed to be room service where prices were not cheap. This cost was boosted by a 20% service charge. The A/C broke and the shower leaked.  There was hair the the sink drain.The hotel is beautiful and the location is great - Across the street from the Bal Harbour Mall. The service however is horrible."
"We stayed in a junior suite and were expecting butler service. This was not provided till we inquired about it after our first night. The butler eventually assigned to us was a "fill-in" who did know have a clue about butler style service. Discreet was certainly not his style and we felt our privacy was invaded. When we eventually told the manager about our concerns, there was nothing done. When shifts changed and other butlers came on, they all seemed to be very chatty and interested in our business than in allowing us to enjoy our extended weekend. When I arrived at The St. Regis last week the reception desk didn't even have my reservation on file. Luckily it appeared the hotel was not busy so they were able to accommodate me.  It was a bad start to the trip and it didnt improve.I stayed at the St Regis in September and was so disappointed we left early. The room was unclean and the staff didn't seem to know anything. Everyone we talked to gave us different information.  Don't go here. I stay at many hotels around the world and have always had good experience with St. Regis.  I was excited to try this new resort and go shopping at the Bal Harbour.  I was surprised at how bad this resort was. The employees are obviously all new and don't know what they are doing. Concierge sent us to the worst restaurant and we had to take a 20 min cab ride to get there. This resort advertises its self as being in Miami but it is not! I wanted to go to south beach to see the sights and enjoy dinner and drinks. It took a half hour to get to the restaurant!  I will not be returning to the hotel. I went to the restaurant and the service was so slow I didnt bother ordering dessert. I was clearly annoyed about the timing and the server didn't speed up or give any explanation.  The food wasnt worth the wait...I stayed at the St Regis because I had a lot of points and thought it would be fun to come to Florida.  It was not the experience I was expected. The hotel is newly opened and they obviously still have not worked out the kinks.  Maybe give it a few more years.On our trip to Miami we stopped in the St Regis to see this new property we had heard so much about. The decor is gorgeous, almost too much.  But the valet was so slow with our car I thought they might have stolen it! Who takes that long to drive a car around the corner?  Never again will I go there unless it is in a taxi.My family has many special requests and I understand that at times there are difficult to fulfill. One of our biggest concerns is my son's dietary restrictions.  He cannot eat gluten or dairy.  The restaurant struggled to provide us with options other than plain chicken and vegetables.  Not only that but every time we ordered anything I  had to repeat all of these restrictions to the server and they mistakenly served him a soup that was cream based after we were informed there was no dairy!This is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in! From the moment we pulled up to the hotel we were immediately unimpressed. It is located near busy, one-way, confusing streets and the traffic could be heard from the room. The front desk staff was unfriendly and were unwilling to fulfill basic requests (room away from elevator and on a high floor). We were so upset with the hotel that we chose not to dine on property, to avoid further let-down. We will not be returning to the Hilton Garden Inn and would highly recommend others not to as well.How difficult is it to provide a crib and hypoallergenic bedding!? I must have waited over an hour at turndown and by that point my baby was fast asleep and we didn't want to move her.   Other than that the hotel was nice but nothing to write home about. My wife and I went to the St Regis for our 2nd anniversary.  It was a big deal for us because we would normally not spend this kind of money on a hotel.  We were disappointed and I felt like I would have had better service in a better location at the W South Beach.  Lessoned learnt. Dont make the same mistake we did.We received a wonderful welcome email after booking our reservation and indicated that we would require transportation arranged from MIA. The concierge was helpful but could have done better. Our flight arrived about 35 minutes early from Zurich and I did not expect to wait because it was St. Regis. When we eventually informed the concierge, they told us that it was handled by an outside company and acted like we were bothering them. Bad start to an otherwise ok stay. Atlantico is terrible. Not worthy of being in a St. Regis. The concept and menu should be reviewed and service needs major improvements. I thought I was going to have a relaxing massage at the spa, unfortunately my interpretation of relaxing was quite different from Sandra's (my therapist). Sandra wore squeaky shoes that made a horribly loud noise each time she took a step in my cold treatment room. I had my face down when I asked her to make the room a little warmer. The only thing I heard were her squeaky shoes and the temperature did not change. Wifi in the rooms facing the ocean comes and goes like a guest of wind. I could not do anything for more than five minutes because I kept dropping my signal. IT was pleasant but unable to fix the issue during my stay. $80 for a full day of kids camp and they are fed chicken nuggets for lunch. I am not looking for my kids to have a gourmet meal but was expecting something more enjoyable and better options. Activities were not suitable for kids who were not from the US. We were extremely pleased with our beautiful cabana and the service. After enjoying a day out by the pool, we decided to use the shower in the cabanas. I guess they had not been used for a few days and when my wife turned the shower on, she got a steady flow of rust in the water. "
"The experience turned even more sour when the staff joked about the situation and expressed concern for the towels which had turned orange. "
"I was expecting more empathy and a better resolution rather than simply allowing us to return to our rooms to take a shower. We stayed over a weekend with a wedding taking place on a Saturday night. Valet took forever and we felt like second class citizens because a high profile guest was either getting married or attending the wedding. Not only was my girlfriend hit by the top of the bottle of champagne when Luis *masterfully (not really)* attempted to saber it, she was served in a cut glass and cut her lip. I was disapointed with the Hilton from the moment I walked in. There was no valet to greet me and the front desk had a bad attitude and did not answer my questions. The room was dusty and made me sneeze all night. However, the housekeeper did have a pleasant attitude when she entered the room. The parking situation was a nightmare with the garage across the road closed. I will never stay at the Hilton again and would advise others not to as well.Nice rooms but poor housekeeping. I first noticed long stretched hairs on the marble floor. The hairs were apparently stretched as a result of a mopping action. After using the shower, I noticed a rather obnoxious message written on the bathroom mirror which was only visible when steam filled the room. Made me question cleanliness of everything else after that. I would not recomment the Lowes Hotel in Nashville, TN. They checked us in to the wrong room, which has already been occupied by someone else. After confronting the front desk, not only were they rude but didnt offer any type of apology for the mishaps. The rooms where not as clean has expected, however the location was ok.I had expected better service at the Loews Hotel in Nashville. The concierge recommented Long Horns for a great steak, which I was expecting someplace other then a chain. It was a good thing we ran into alot of friendly people on the streets or our trip would have been medicore.You do not want to stay at the Loews Hotel in Nashville, TN. My necklace was "lost" in my room, and after calling to ask for assistance, no one ever contacted me back. I went down and requested to speak to a manager and he was unavailable. It has been two weeks since we stayed and still no word.. After getting food poison at the Loew's Hotel eat. I contacted housekeeping to bring extra towels to my room and once I received them they were stained and dirty. After asking for new towels to be brought, the housekeeper rolled her eyes and said sure. Not the best place to eat or stay.After checking in to the Loews hotel in Nashville, TN after a long drive, our bags ended up in someone elses room. After we spoke to the manager, it took them an hour to locate our belongings.  The bellman asked us for a tip, which was very unexpected being they were the one's that lost our bags.The Lowe's in Nashville, is an ok place to stay if you use to staying at a best western. The little cafe was not the greatest. Would recomment you walking across the street if your hungry. The staff seemed very unorganized and undertrained. Concierge was somewhat knowledgable of the area. Should have done my own reshearch before staying in Nashville.The Loews Hotel's location is great but the overall service of the hotel was a disapointment. We listened to housekeepers argue on the way to our room. Once we made it, the room was not as clean as expected. After requesting a new room, they mentioned that no other room was available. We requested a discount and was denied. Next time we will stay down the street.The Loew's Hotel in Nashville, not what I had expected. Decor very outdated, service lacked personality and the rooms not as clean and organized. Great location, terrible hotel.After checking into the Lowes in Nashville, the front desk associate made a racial comment as I was getting my room key. I requested to speak with a manager, and the gentlemen told me that I needed to go through him first. Not only was I offended, but I requested that the room to be cancelled and my full refund return. Tom assured me that there was no way a full refund was optional. I sat in the lobby and contacted corporate.Joe was very helpful however was told the same ol, same ol.., "We will get back to you". Never heard a word and half of my deposit was returned. Upon entering the hotel I had to wait at the front desk for several minutes as the agent was answering many phone calls. It was a busy evening and she seemed to be the only one at the desk. There should certainly be several peaople servicing guests on a night with high demand. The first impression is the most important and this totally set me off on the wrong foot. This was a business trip and I was in a hurry, I would have appreciated a prompt check in. I was hoping that the room and hotel facilities would better my mood but this was not the case. It was a very basic room with out any special touches. The internet access was weak and could not check my email which was a huge disapointment as I had work to tend to. I hope my comments are read and the problems are addressed. However, I will probably bot return. The Loews Hotel in Nashville was not as nice as the other Loews hotels that I have stayed out. Was expecting good ol boy service being located in the heart of Nashville. Lots of non friendly staff with an outdated look.I paid $700.00 for a shoe box size of rooms?  The view is great being near Central Park area, but I need to comfort and I do not like any hotels thats charge us everything (internet, no coffee machine, etc.).  We already paid the premium rates and on top of it, upon check-out I paid 14.95 for internet connection per day?  Absurd! Great view but I am not in my room most of the times to stare at it.   I need space for my shopping bags and coffee as soon as I wake up.  Do I have to pay $25.00 for coffee every morning?Too expensive for the size of the room we paid.  The location is great if you are looking to visit Central Park, but not convenient to other major attraction.  The decor is very traditional.   Came to Peninsula with friends to celebrate New Year, the lounge was full so we were directed to other side, next to restaurant to see the maitre 'd who was a female. She told us just to take any seat. We sat for 20 minutes next to a tray of dirty dishes near the bar because they obviously were overstaffed. A prosecco with a Campari drop for color is the same price this year as a champagne + Campari drop, $35 per glass. When we asked, our waiter told us "Here, our prosecco and champagne cost the same." We were shocked. Upon leaving, I did my ritual of asking the doorman in which direction the closest subway is because, even though I'm a local, I always like to see the type of customer service I get w/a response. He told me "you can check your smartphone or go inside and ask the Concierge because I have no idea." I wouldn't stay here again--or spend a single dollar on a drink--when Penninsula NYC hires staff like this, at the holidays or at any time of theyear. "
"I contacted the front desk for a late check-out (1:00pm instead of standard checkout time) and the person immidiately said NO!  we are full without even trying!  I will stay somewhere else next time."
"The most expesive hotel I ever stayed at with luck of personality.  They need to hire new people who cares about their guests.  They do not smile and not willing to assist.  Lack of attention to details, the rooms need major renovation and staff could be a little friendlier to be rated 5 Star.  I will not return nor recommend this hotel.The rates at this hotel should be lower than other 4 Star Hotel in New York City!  Our rooms was so small, the staff are not 5 Star and the decor are definitely should be 4 Star.  They charge for everything, no added values except the name.  I would stay in another hotel next time.  I could not believe how DIRTY the room was! I think I even saw a BUG in the room. I was totally disgusted with the room and public areas. Are these rooms being inspected? The staff was friendly but I cannot justify spending $150+ on a filthy and infested room.Great location, but that's all!  The rooms are too small for the price we paid for, the staff are not friendly and not helpful.  They ignored us after we checked in most of the times.  We stayed there for 6 nights and felt like they don't care.  They did not changed our sheets until the third night.  This should be an option for us not a mandatory.  We did not get  a discount on our rates for not changing our bed sheets every night.  We had to pay for internet connection, it should be included in our rates.   I suggest for you to stay in another hotel that cares!"
"I cannot believe how disorganized this hotel is, my reservation was LOST. I saved my confirmation email and then they were able to find my reservation. Then the rate did not match my confirmation, I was thankful that I saved this email. It took me about 20 minutes to check in and this was not the way I wanted to start off my vacation! The room was ok, nothing to "write home" about and there was a lot of dust. The location is great, close to a lot of shops and restaurants but the service was a mess. I would not spend $200 there again for a night. There is better valie for your money in Ithaca. It took FOREVER to find this hotel. With all the confusing intersections and one-way roads in Ithaca, I thought we would never find the place. Once we arrived and realized we had to park so far away it really disapointed us! The front desk seemed to have non-stop phones ringing (they should have an operator!). I prefer to stay at a hotel that is easy to find with convenient parking. You could even hear the traffic from the room! The restaurant was nice and had good options but there are other places bear by that we chose to try. I am not sure if we will return, I am sure there is a more convenient place to stay in Ithaca. The entire experience was a disaster! From front desk to the restaurant the staff was very unprofessional and I heard a lot of gossiping and complaining about other guests. This made me feel very uncomfortable as I wondered if they spoke about me. Where are the supervisors and managers that watch over the staff members? The room was a standard, 'run of the mill' room. The staff and room have turned me away from wanted to return to the Hilton. I love the location of this hotel but that is where the positves end... The hotel is located in downtown Ithaca; close to shopping, great restaurants, bars. Perfect for the night life. However, the staff is rude and unorganized. The room is dirty and unexciting. I had to wait a long time to check in as there was a long line and only two front desk agents. They did not apologize for my wait and made me feel very unwelcome. I reported the issues in the room before I went to dinner and none of them were ever addressed. I was so disapointed with my stay and noticed a few other hotels in or near downtown Ithaca and will look into those for a future stay. The parking situation at this hotel is aweful! You have to park in a garage that is a ten minute walk away and it is unsafe in there. My car got damaged! And when I left an article of clothing there, they told me that it was never found. I know I left it and I am it is disapointing that they have dishonest staff. The room could certainly use an update, as well as the internet. The staff was ok but a bit more friendliness wouldn't hurt. The restaurant is ok, but there are many better option close-by on the commons. I hope my concerns are addressed as I am sure I'm not the only ones who experienced these issues. For a Hilton brand, this property is overdue for an changes in both the staff or training as well as the outdated facilities. The rooms were nothing special, and the bathrooms were particularly small. The staff seemed disinterested and did not display the authentic interest to serve that I have come to expect from Hilton.Fives is the most arrogant restaurant I have been to... I entertained clients at the Peninsula NYC, where I was staying and received the poorest service ever...Staff was snooty, food was luke warm and presentation average.The Hilton has a nice enterance and I was checked in to an ok room (a little too close to the elevator though). When I asked for recommendations for dining the first option the front desk gave me was Kilpatricks which is located in the hotel. Upon entering I was impressed with the layout and the interesting booths but this is where my pleasure stopped. As soon as I sat down I could hear the table next to my complain about their dished to the waitress. She then got her manager and she was very unhospitable to the couple! She didn't even comp a meal, she basicall said 'deal with it'. Isn't the customer always right? That manager was a poor example to her wait staff and is clearly in the wrong industry. My food was ok but I feel that I should have went and dined somewhere else on the Commons. The rooms could use a facelift and they should really get rid of the duvets! Overall, I was VERY unimpressed with my stay and will find a better value for my money elsewhere.  I booked this hotel because I had heard that it was "the place to stay in NYC". This is certainly NOT "the place to stay" it is an absoloute rip-off and the service is horrible. Staff has a "too cool" attitude and the rooms are uninteresting. I found a stain in my sheets upon arrival and therefore I called housekeeping to complain and they did not even apologize. They then took an hour to come up and service my room. For the $800.00 per night I was paying I found this to be insulting and extremely dissapointing. The staff was so stuffy and uncaring at this Soho Hotel. It really ruined our experience, and we will not be back.The hotel itself was okay, but there was so much noise coming from the street at night, that it made the cost of the hotel not make any sense. We complained but were met with no solution other than earplugs. The staff just didn't seem to care about our experience. Plus, the lighting in the rooms was so dark and dim. We had high expectations, and they were, unfortunately, not met. The best part of staying at this hotel is the restaurant. The rooms just aren't comfortable, and it would have been nice if there had been complimentay wi-fi. It felt cold, and the rooms were too small. My stay at The Mercer was just okay, I would stay. For the prices we were charged, I thought that the staff was not very warm, the rooms were too small, and I thought that breakfast should have been included. Room service took way too long to arrive, and when I had arrived at the hotel the day earlier, although my room was not ready, no one offered to take my bags or make me comfortable while I waited. It was a disappointing experience all around. This stay will be my last. You just don't get enough bang for your buck at this hotel. Even the King Suite is pretty small, and although I can see how some guests might think this hotel is chic, it was not warm enough for me. Mostly white and steel. Beware of this feeling before booking your room. I was a recent guest at The Peninsula New York and ended up waiting over 20 minutes to check-in, to then be told my accommodations were not available until after 3pm. I sat in the lounge area, where I waited, yet again, for a server to greet me and take my order. I was not provided with any extraordinary levels of service one would expect. When I finally did check in, I walked into a small, somber room, which was a true disappointment. My luggage had not been sent up by this time and I had to wait an hour for the Bellmen to show up.I was not impressed with the amenities at this Soho Hotel. And I thought the staff was a bit unfriendly. I am accustomed to having a gym in my hotel, and I thought it was an inconvenience to have to travel elsewhere. The beds were not very comfortable, unfortunately, and there was a problem with my reservation when I arrived. All and all, I did not feel like it was a great experience. As one of the more expensive hotels in the Ithaca area, I was disappointed with the overall experience of my recent stay. We came to visit the Ithaca College and Cornell campuses and when we discussed this at check-in, we were not assisted with any college or area specific information that may have proved helpful for our visit. This may be expecting too much, but a simple area map or suggestions on where to eat on either campus would have been great tips to enhance our visit.There were bedbugs at this hotel! Do not stay!I just stayed at this hotel, and I wish that the website had given better pictures of the rooms, because I found ours to be so small, and there was a big stain on our couch in the room. It just did not feel taken care of, and little things like clean towels being replenished at night did not happen. I was surpised because I usually like Andre Balaz's properties, but this was a let down. Our stay in the hotel was a mixed experience. The staff at the hotel was okay, but our server at Mercer Kitchen was terrible. Rude and full of attitude. I wish it had not colored my experience of the hotel at large, but it did. Avoid the restaurant, and you'll have a better stay. This is a friend's favorite place to stay in NYC, so I was really looking forward to my experience, but I could not have been more disappointed. The room felt dirty and dark, the front desk did not have any new, exciting suggestions for dining that I did not already know, and in general, the furniture, including the bed, was not comfortable. The restaurant was okay, dinner better than lunch, but for the price, I wanted a much better experience than what I got. I was expecting luxury, but I got ordinary. I wasn't impressed as I was when I stayed in their NYC and ATL hotel. The hotel needs renovation and more staffing. Check in took too long and valet was about a 20 minute wait. The Peninsula Spa is not what I hoped for....Described as one of the best in NYC and one of the reasons I booked the hotel. The staff is unfriendly and unfamiliar with their services. Additionallly, the treatments are very average and too costly.The Peninsula NYC is not comparable to any other of its sister hotels. Located in a very part of the City, it is impossible to find a cab, rooms are noisy, staff is cold and the hotel overall provides average amenities.Felt claustrophobic...The ceilings are low, the elevators are miniscule and the accommodations are average. Rated a 5 star, I have stayed in much better hotels in the City, rated less.Not a family destination. I traveled to the hotel with my family where I had hoped I would have been looked after..This hotel is perhaps convenient for business, but not for leisure. No unique offerings, and menus are not tailored for children.The Mercer Hotel sadly did not live up to my expectations. We usually stay uptown but wanted to try something new for this stay as we wanted to do a lot of eating at downtown restaurants, we love NYC restaurants! The location was just right but that was about the only thing that was right about The Mercer. Jean Georges is the name behind their "Mercer Kitchen" so we were excited about this aspect of the hotel as well as we have enjoyed his other restaurants in the past. We asked the concierge to make us a reservation for two on the third evening of our stay (so it wasn't even a same or next day reservation) and they told us that we could not get a reservation. So I can't even eat at the hotel I am staying at?! We explained that we were very excited to eat at Mercer Kitchen and it is part of why we stayed at the property, if there were not tables for hotel guests that is something that they should say at time of booking or at least offer to make a reservation. Then the Front Desk proceeded to tell us that room service is available 24/7....seriously? We ended up walking around and finding a nice meal on our own with little help of the hotel. When we did get room service it was cold, uninteresting  and slow. SO, if you are a foodie don't waste your time at The Mercer.Paying more than $200/night, I expected to have a better than average stay and interaction at the Hilton Garden Inn. However, this was unfortunately not the case. Our room was not ready until 5:00pm (2 hours after guaranteed check-in) and even though we notified the front desk that we were on a tight schedule (visiting our son for parent's weekend at his fraternity) no particular urgency was seen on their part or alternative services offered to store our bags or assist us in any way until our room was ready 3 hours after we arrived. Needless to say, I will seek other accommodations next time we come to Ithaca.I know the hotel was slow because I didn't see a lot of people in the lobby and got the room on a discount on Expedia. I asked for an upgrade because it was our anniversary and I was told no because of the rate. For a special occasion, I feel that that the hotel should try to do something to make you feel good. I had some bites on my legs. I swear they are bed bugs. I complained at checkout and the manager denied it. She took down my information but no one has contacted me. They missed my wake up call and I was late to my meetings. Valet lost the keys to my car and it was Sunday. They were not able to get me keys and send me my car until Tuesday. The hotel rented me a car to drive back to Knoxville that day, but it took about 6 hours. Bathroom was dirty and there was hair on the sheets. Not a good first impression. Apparently the hotel "lost" my reservation and they did not have a room for me. At first it was my fault until I showed a confirmation number. After a long day of work and then traveling, the last thing I want to happen is to arrive at my hotel and be sent to another one because you did a poor job of managing reservations. Hotel does not remember room preference and seems to try to give unusual rooms such as disability room or a closet. I would have liked to have seen more information regarding the cost of services on your website, for example I had to call the hotel to understand the cost for parking and internet access as it was not easily found on the website.I stay on a regular basis. At least one week every other month. Every time I check in I get asked the same question, "Is this your first stay with us?" No, in fact it's my 100th. Please implement some sort system so that you know which room I like, what paper I want and that I do have a car (every time). Keep my credit card on file - I use the same one every time.After having stayed at the Peninsula Hong Kong, I would have expected so much more...I asked to be taken to my offices in the hotel car and was offer a Mini-Cooper!"
"I had wanted to entertain a client at the rooftop bar, which was closed for an event and suggested the lobby bar. When I arrived, there were no seats to be found and the Manager was less than accommodating!I will never stay at the Hilton Garden Inn again. We visited last weekend as part of the Cornell class reunions and were hysterical when we found bed bugs in our room! The hotel only offered to change the sheets and would not let us move rooms as they did not have any other available rooms during our stay. Having no other choices, we slept with the bugs... It would have been nice if they had arranged for an exterminator to come clean our room when the problem was found, but I guess that would have been too much work for the staff.Overall, inconvenient. Rooms are small, one has to walk up flights of stairs to check-in which is most inconvenient for seniors and anyone with handicaps. Elevators are small and cramped. Spent my honeymoon night at The Peninsula...very disappointing. Though I did highlight it was my wedding night when I made the reservations, we received no special treatment during our stay. Our name was never used by any staff member and though we spent several nights, we were never recognized.The Peninsula, over rated and over priced! There are many other hotels in the City, with more competitive rates and better amenities. Location is in a bustling part of the City, where one is mobbed by people as soon as you walk out the door.I choose this hotel due to its proximity to my meetings that I had while I was in town.  The locationw as definitely good for that purpose, but that's about it!  The hotel is located in a shopping center that is a bear to get in and out of since it is the holiday season.  I literally had to wait at crowded intersections that were jammed just to get into the shopping plaza and then wait for pedestrians, etc.  Don't get me wrong, the setting is quaint, but not when you are busy and trying to get in and out and back to your room quickly.  I frequently travel to the area for business and thought I would try staying at the Renaissance this time around.  The hotel was a bit impersonal, I felt a bit like an average joe checking in a getting my key card, which for the price I paid, was a bit unnerving.  I didn't feel like the price was justified and it seemed more like I was paying for the expensive real estate in the snazzy shopping plaza it was located in.  I would consider staying again because it was convenient for my meetings, however I hope they do some customer service training with their staff!We live an hour from Raleigh and thought it would be fun to do some shopping and dining in the area for a little staycation.  The location of Renaissance was perfect.  Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say about our stay - as the rest of the experience was just so so.  We didn't experience any try guest service and I'm not sure how they can be considered four diamond when they barely look at you when you are speaking to them.  Yes the rooms are large and comfortable, but it is the people that truly make the place and I would say they need to do some serious training!During our recent stay at the Renaissance, we were highly disappointed with the facility of the pool.  We were with our young children who love to swim and we specificially stayed here because they offer an indoor pool.  What isn't so clear when booking the hotel is that the pool is actually located in the Gold's Gym next door to the hotel and that it was under maintenance for our stay.  This was a huge disappointment for our children and for us as this was an activity we had planned on doing.  Unfortunately there was no alternative so we had to make do with the shopping and entertainment options in the North Hills area which ended up being fine.  I think the hotel needs to communicate better about its facilities.I enjoy the Renaissance brand and didn't hesitate to book this hotel for my upcoming trip to the area.  I was highly disappointed with the accommodations though.  My room overlooked a busy highway which considering the quaint location of North Hills, was a supreme disappoinment.  I found the room to be noisy and lack any special qualities.  I think this was a terrible lack of planning to build an expensive hotel overlooking a busy highway.Honestly, it seems like everything went wrong for my wife and I at our recent stay at the Renaissance.  It started when we arrived and the front desk manager informed us that they were sold out of king beds and ended with a billing issue that took 15 minutes to sort out.  We weren't in the hotel very much during our stay and I'm glad we weren't because there was little character to the place and we preferred walking around the quaint North Hills shopping area more than staying in our room overlooking a highway.  Next time we come to Raleigh I will definitely be staying somewhere else!  We wanted a bit of R&R on our recent overnight in Raleigh and had heard alot about the Renaissance and decided to give it a try!  We were very unimpressed and don't get what all the buzz is about.  The staff was friendly, but they didn't do anything to wow me and my husband.  I guess we thought there was going to be something more special about the place but we just didn't see it.  Also, the shopping center it is located in is charming but BUSY.  We felt like we didn't really get away because we were bombarded with shoppers, traffic, stores, lights and it really wasn't a relaxing environment.  I'll come back to this hotel when I have a to do list I'm trying to accomplish!One of the male front desk agents, I believe his name was Mark?, was quite possibly the rudest staff member I have ever encountered at a hotel in my many travels. When we asked for restaurant recommendations, he simply pointed to the door and told us to walk outside... later that night, we asked for a wakeup call and he said there was an alarm clock in our room... and even still, when we asked for a late checkout the next day, he refused, saying that if we left at any point after the 12:00pm checkout time, there would be an automatic $50 late departure charge billed to us, ridiculous!!For the price, this hotel is overrated!  The rooms are boring, like a typical Hampton Inn at best and the amenities are lacking.  To be honest, you would probably be happier at a Hampton Inn paying a lower rate and getting nice amenities like free breakfast!  This hotel really offered no value and while the staff was nice, I wouldn't say they were particularly polished or professional.  Most times I walked by the desk, they were chatting with one another and didn't even notice me.It took me a week to calm down before I could write this review.  My stay was so horrible that I honestly will never stay at another Renaissance hotel anywhere.  My room was dirty, no ifs ands or buts about it, it was dirty.  When I called to the desk to complain and request a room change they apologized and offered to send someone right up.  When the housekeeper arrived she confessed that they never cleaned the room and that they shouldn't have checked me into it.  I felt so gross and felt I should get compensated in some way.  Unfortunately the manager couldn't do anything.  They were sold out so there were no available rooms to move me to, so I had to wait it out with one glass of wine as an apology.  I really think this place needs to reconsider how it handles its customers!The reason for my low rating is because the price you pay does not equal what you get.  There are plenty of other lower priced options that you'd get so much more for.  This hotel thinks it is luxury but it is really just faking it.  They offer almost nothing in regards to amenities, they even charge for internet!  I'm used to staying in hotels that care about their customers and want to promote loyalty, but I just didn't find a good reason to want to come back to this hotel brand.  Next time I will stay somewhere without the fancy facade for half the price and get more!I chose the Mercer hotel after a recommendation by a friend. I normally stay at a different downtown location but my friend persuaded me to stay here with her so I tought I should try it. Prior to my stay I was particularly impressed with the amenity list, ie same day pressing service, day passes to soho equinox, etc. Unfortuately these did not live up to my expectations! I called for pressing service in the morning as I was headed to the event that I came to NYC for. It took them an hour to pick it up (I called at 6:30 am to ensure that it would be ready by that evening), afer I had to call and remind them. Then, I told them that it absoloutly had to be ready at 6:30. At 6:45 when I called down they claimed that they did not have a piece of laundry for me, We went back and forth for an hour and it was still not found...this obviosuly made me late to my event with nothing to wear, the dress was finally found the next morning, aparently it had been marked as next day service. DO NOT OFFER SERVICES IF YOU CAN'T PROVIDE THEM! The rest of my stay was fine, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth to spend that kind of money on a hotel that provides unreliable service.I checked in to the Mercer Hotel very excited for a weekend of shopping and downtown dining with my sister. After a long redeye flight we were excited to take a nap before our day began. We booked the evening before so we could check in for our 7:30 am arrival that day. Two days before arrival I had called the reservationist to make sure this was all set. When we arrived they claimed to have no record of this and because we did not show up the evening before, they took a last minute booking and our room was not ready until 2 pm. They were extremely apologetic but this was very frusturating as I double checked this with their reservationist, maybe she just did not care enough to write it down? The Jean Georges restaurant in the hotel was good, not my favorite of his though...I prefer the J&G Grill. Otherwise, good location and slept well once we got into our room.Do not stay here, there is an attitude of the front desk staff that will make you want to run out the door!! This is not what I expected from supposedly one of NYC's best hotels?The rooms are fine, nothing extremely special and a nice lobby but the staff was too busy snickering behind the desk and perching their lips with their overly trendy looks to have interest in the guests. I simply found them unwelcoming and unapproachable. I even heard them talking badly about another guest, how very unprofessional! Too bad because the location is great if you want to be in the heart of soho shopping, its just not where I would want to call my home when visting NYC.If you are a NYC traveler who relies on room service throughout your stay, do not stay here! When I come to New York I am traveling for business and on the go, therefore normally have my meals in the room. Considering the hotel's reputation, you would this that they would figure this out by now. There was something wrong with every order I made, whether it was wrong, cold, or late. For a traveler such as myself this is an important aspect and says a lot about the back of house organization. Also, not having a gym on property is a bit of a let down, although Equinox is a nice gym I really do not want to fight the crowds, (at peak hours it is very likely that you will have to wait for a treadmill)  having a gym on property would really up the value of this property. I am currently looking for a new go-to in NYC, it is just not the place for a business traveler.Better options in downtown NYC, this hotel does not provide the service to be expected at a top rated hotel. When we arrived there were no bellmen to assist with luggage in sight. After we lugged our wee's work of luggage through the door, we then waited at the reception desk for at least 10 minutes while two receptionists were assisting one guest.  They seemed to be having more of a pow-wow. You would think that they at leask would have acknowleged us? The rooms are a bit uninteresting, clean and fine enough but little effort seemed to be put into the design. I like the idea of boutique hotels but when they do not provide the service it is extremely dissapointing.I booked a Courtyard room at the Mercer but when I arrived they had me in for a Deluxe room. It was just me for this stay therefore I did not need a Deluxe which I have stayed in there a few times before. When I arrived they told me that I was in a Deluxe room. I said that I booked a Couryard for this stay so it must be a mistake. They claimed that this had been changed and unfortunately they were sold out and did not have a Courtyard room to put me in. I figured that this may be an upgrade due to their availability but when I checked out they charged me the full price of a Deluxe room and began to argue that I had changed the room type. This to me was terrible customer service and extremely disrespectful to accuse me of something that I did not do. Eventually they removed the charge but it was handled extremely poorly. Although I always enjoyed my stays at The Mercer I do not want to deal with their staff again, therefore will not be returning.If you are looking for an unattentive and snooty staff, overpriced drinks, and a sterile enviornment than you have come to the right place. Do not waste your money here, there are so many other better options at downtown hotels in NYC. We finally got a seat at the bar after waiting for 30 + minutes as in house guests and did not recieve the welcome expected. The bartender seemed more interested in a group of hip people who did not seem like they were staying there. I am not an attention seeker but as an in house guest, you would think that we would get a little bit of special treatment. Such as, I think they should reserve some space for guests only as I do not think I should have to fight a crowd to get a seat at my own hotel's lounge. When we arrived to check-in at the hotel, we were downgraded from our whirlpool suite to a traditional room for no apparent reason. The manager apologized and assured us that our room rate had been "significantly" reduced to make up for the oversight, however, it was "significantly" reduced to the best available rate for the traditional room type that I could have booked online. Otherwise, the stay was fine and the staff was nice enough, but you guarantee your room reservation with a credit card for a reason, to make sure you get that room! Do not waste your time with this hotel, for my husband's 40th birthday I booked the Studio room, which was lovely. I let them know ahead of time and asked to put champagne in the room. This was not done, I kindly called because I was hoping they could just bring it up then. There was no apology but it was brought up relatively promptly. At the end of our stay $150 was charged to our bill for the champagne which initally came across as complimentary when the reservationist asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. We did not say anything I just think that is portrays poor hospitality and communication. Also, we had them book a meal for us at Del Posto (which was delicious by the way!!) for the evening of my husband's birthday. The concierge confirmed 7:30 to us but when we arrived to the restaurant they had us in for 6:30? Luckily even though they were packed the restaurant had us sit at the bar for a drink and got us in by 8:15. This was a big mistake of the concierge's part, lucky for them that Del Posto was so accomodating. If you stay at the Mercer double check with the restaurant what time your reservation is yourself!!I just checked out of the Renaissance Raleigh North Hills and it was an absolute disaster.  From the time of check in until check out it was nothing but poor service.  I would never return to this hotel.  Do not stay here!Overall poor hotel.  No customer service, no attention to detail and miserable looking staff.  The front desk agent was so rude to us upon check in when telling us our room was not ready.  I will never stay here again.DO NOT STAY HERE!  I was here on business and have never been treated so poorly.  Rooms were new, but not well kelp with stains and scuffed furniture.  Housekeeping service was not complete with leaving trash under the bed.  No one seemed happy to work there.  When traveling as much as I do I want to see happy people.The worst hotel....I have been treated better at a Motel 6!  Other people must notice this because the place was empty the whole time I was there.  No one in the lobby or restaurant.  No one would even say hello to me when I walked in and the staff were never paying attention and only talking in groups.  There are shops and restaurants in the mall complex, but it is not worth the price to stay at this hotelStayed here for a conference and it was a very bad experience.  The food for the conference was not edible and they ran out of multiple items for lunch.  No one ever came in to clean the meeting rooms and there were dirty dishes from breakfast at 5:00p!  Don't know if they were understaffed or did not care, but either way it shows.Worst hotel in Charleston.  Upon arrival we waited ten minutes for someone to valet our car.  The bellman was rude when he removed our luggage from our car and even complained he couldn't believe he had to unload all of the luggage for a two night stay.  When we approached the front desk to check-in they could not find our reservation.  After arguing that we DID have a reservation at their hotel we had to show them the print out of our e-mail confirmation before they could find our room in their system.  Once checked in we went to our room and did not receive the champagne and lady fingers as promised on their website.  I just wanted to take a quick shower and a nap after our long trip.  When I pulled back the sheets on the bed there were blood stains on the sheets.  Of course their response was that's impossible.  Only after a 45 min wait for the manager to call me back and then another 30 min after that did we get clean sheets put on the bed.  Couldn't wait to leave this hotel.Terrible hotel and service.  Nothing about the hotel was good, actually everything was beyond bad.  No one was friendly or accomodating to any needs.  I couldn't even get a smile out of anyone.  Miserable experience.This hotel does not get it.  I travel for business a lot and I just want the basics: clean room, friendly and efficient service.  I checked in late in the evening and there was no one at the desk to greet me, room had some used towels in them and breakfast service in the restaurant took forever.POOR!!!! Extremely dissatisfied with my stay here.  Horrible service  and poor experience.  I would not return to this hotel.  They brand themselves as a luxury hotel and charge one of the highest rates in the area, but cannot deliver on that promise.My wife and I are locals who booked the "Romance Package" on the Hilton website a couple of weeks ago, to celebrate our 10th anniversary to get away from the kids for the weekend. However, we were beyond disappointed with our stay that was anything but Romantic because of the Hotel's mistakes."
"The "Romance Package" guarantees an early check-in, which they were unable to accommodate, as we didn't get our room until 3:30pm even when we arrived at 1:30pm (regular checkin is at 3pm). The sparkling wine was initially a bottle of non-alcoholic cider that was corrected after we notified room service. And our "full-breakfast for two" in a hotel designated restaurant resulted in a Starbuck's coffee and a danish...not quite my idea of a full breakfast. "
"Needless to say, we were upset that our hopes of a romantic getaway were dashed by the poor service of the staff here.I have never been treated so badly at a hotel.  I usually don't comment on these sites, but I had to share what a terrible stay I had here.  First location is not great-in the middle of a traffic congested parking lot and Target.  It was a pain to get my car and get in and out of the area.  No one showed the basics of customer service or looked at all that they enjoyed their job.  I felt like a number and everything was so robotic and not personallized.  Finally, I was personally insulted by a front desk agent that implyed that I did not pay for something I did not consume.Never will return to this hotel! The hotel was busy with what looked like a large conference and wow did the place fall apart.  I couldn't get basics like checking in on time, extra towels delivered, luggage delivered etc.  It took over an hour for each.  Everyone kept apologizing, but nothing was getting done.  One person even told me that they were severely understaffed-great to hear from the customer side.  Never again!Although the hotel is centrally located in the historic district not worth the stay at this establishment.  While staying at this hotel we were very disappointed with the poor attitude of the staff.  From the valet to the front desk at check-in were not given a warm welcome.  I expected southern hospitality and instead received southern hostility.  Don't bother calling the front desk they never answer the phone.  The only person that was nice to us was our housekeeper.  The room was only OK.  For the price I was paying I expected a more luxurious room.  The concierge couldn't answer any of my questions and kept trying to push us towards only one tour company and one restaurant.The French Quarter Inn has a lot lacking.  The rooms are dingy and the carpets could use a good cleaning.  I wouldn't walk barefoot in our room and always had on shoes.  Definitely could use a complete overhaul and reburbish the rooms.  We found a cockroach in our bathroom that was still alive.  When we called the froont desk to complain they told us that it was a palmetto bug and that was normal for Charleston. We couldn't sleep at night because of all of the loud partying on the street outside.  There are too many bars around this hotel that play loud music until 2:00 am.  The rooms should be sound proofed better.  Management informed us they could not move us to another room.  No compensation was made for our poor experience at the hotel.Apparently the  front desk person had just started working the day we arrived.  We waited behind four other people to check-in.   Who would have thought it could take 45 minutes just to check-in to a small hotel.   She seemed frazzled and confused.  From the cheesy shops to the overpriced restaurant we were not impressed with this hotel.  The wait staff was snooty and it took thirty minutes to receive our over priced drink order.  The food was OK but nothing special.  Everytime we left the hotel we would see employees standing outside smoking.  I definitely would not recommend this hotel.My family and I stayed at the French Quarter inn for  weekend this summer and we ended up having quite a few problems. We were placed in a room facing the parking garage; when we attempted to get our room moved  we were told that the hotel was sold out. The concierge at the time recommended a restaurant that was all the way on the other side of town and while nice, we should have been informed that we needed to wear something nicer as we felt uncomfortable the entire dinner. The decor and room were fine but for the price the hotel needs to fine tune their customer service.Stay as far away from this hotel as you can! I booked a last minute deal online and thought I would be getting bargain! What a disappointment. Upon arrival I had to wait at least 10 minutes until a bellman appeared, and then had to wait another 30 minutes until my luggage arrived. Walking past the front desk, do not expect a smile or friendly greeting, all you will receive is a bored look if they even glance up from their computer. I wrote a complaint on the response card provided in the room but have not received a follow back from management. Very disappointed.I should have known when I booked my reservation that the French Quarter Inn was a poor choice. The reservationist made me feel like my questions were stupid and she tried to get me off the phone as soon as possible. Valet service is slow and at $20.00, not worth it. If you can just take a taxi or pedicab and leave your vehicle at home. We found a palmetto bug in our room and when we contacted the front desk they informed us that these are found in all hotels in the south. I'm pretty sure any luxury hotel will not be crawling with bugs. We will never ever return to this "hotel".I recently took my wife on an anniversary getaway. Upon making my reservation, I was assured I would receive a complimentary upgrade since we would be celebrating a special occasion. This did not happen. Our room was fine but we received no special amenities, chocolate covered strawberries, nothing. It was a bit of a let down. From there things just kept getting worse: no hot water, when we called to get this fixed we were told maint. would not be in until the morning. Room service pricing was ridiculous, we ended up just looking for our own breakfast in the morning. We had a early flight and asked for a wake up call that we never received. We almost missed our flight. Beware; if you are looking for anything other than a bed to lie your head down, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.From all the previous reviews I had read, I thought this hotel was going to be flawless. Unfortunately, it does not live up to its luxury hotel sales tag. I could not get the air conditioner to work properly, front desk staff was not overly eager to help, and it did not seem like the concierge knew very much about the city. Would not recommend anyone to stay here.I am a HHonors member and redeemed some of my accrued points for a rewards stay at The Hilton Garden in a couple of weeks ago. However, when I arrived, I was told that due to occupancy levels, this could not be permitted, even though I had a rewards stay confirmation letter. I ended up paying an absurd room rate that I would not have booked had I known I was going to have to pay that rate, however, at that time there were no other hotel rooms available in the area. I'm not sure if this a HHonors problem or a hotel specific ineptitude issue, but I was upset that no discount or recovery in the very least of ways was even offered to make up for a mistake that was clearly not my fault.While the hotel staff was friendly enough, the room itself really needed some upgrades. The carpet looked worn and old, the room had a very unusual odor that lingered even after turndown service, dust found in the corners and crevices of the room. Housekeeping really seems to be doing just the bare minimum and not looking for any type of attention to detail. We were very disappointed in our stay.I am a meeting planner and arrived early before my group this past week. I was shocked to find that even though I had booked over 20 rooms with this hotel, I was not going to have any type of customer service during my stay. We were a late check in but we had online confirmations for a luxury king room. What we ended up with was two queen beds in a room next to the elevator. When I addressed my concerns I was given no apology. The only explanation was that they were full and were unable to move us. My wife and I were forced to sleep in separate beds despite being married for 10 years. Next, when we tried to watch television the channels were fuzzy. I did not even attempt to contact the front desk due to the poor service provided at check in. When my group arrived the next day check in took forever. I would have thought a hotel of this caliber would be equipped to handle a normal group check in. We will look elsewhere the next time Charleston is on our business agenda.My girlfriends and I decided to splurge on a summer getaway and chose the French Quarter Inn. Needless to say, we were not impressed. we found mold on the ceiling vents of our room which created a horrible odor. When we called down to complain, they offered to switch us to a higher level room, but we would be responsible for the additional room charge. Unbelievable!For the amount of service we received, we should have payed a holiday inn rate. Instead, we payed $300.00 for a so so room and so so service. This would have been fine if we did not have the expectation of a luxury hotel. Hotel soap, conditioner was cheap, and they did not have any shoe shining capabilities. Valet service was slow and we received no explanation for having to wait 30 minutes for our car.Website was very difficult to navigate and when I tried to make reservation it kept giving me an error message. Called to make reservation over the phone and had to listen to a lot of hotel descriptions and up selling when all I wanted to do was make a quick reservation online. Really gave the hotel a bad first impression. Check in was fine but had to wait 30 minutes to get our luggage; we were almost late to our dinner reservations because of this. We were not informed that our credit card was going to have a pending charge on our account that remained for a week after our stay. Was very disappointed and we will not be returning.If you are traveling for work I would definitely not stay at the French Quarter Inn.  The free WIFI never works.  Of course the staff blamed it on the type of tablet I had but while talking to other guests they couldn't pick up the WIFI either.  Not being able to work from my hotel room when I had meeetings scheduled in Charleston was disastrous for my business.  In order to work I had to go to a nearby restaurant that offered free WIFI.  Worst stay in Charleston!!!  Being frequent travelers to Charleston we decided to try the French Quarter Inn.  What a disappointment.  The rooms were small and dirty.  Champagne was flat and cheap.  Cookies in the evening were stale.  Coffee was cold and weak.  Breakfast was the same every morning.  We saw staff wiping off tables with dirty rags, not washing their hands and then handling breakfast items without using tongs.  We never at anything at this hotel again after viewing such unsanitary behavior.  I planned a romantic getaway at the French Quarter Inn to propose to my girlfriend.  I had contacted the concierge and had asked that upon our arrival the following items to be placed in our room.  Bottle of Moet et Chandon, chocolate covered strawberries, Charcuterie & Cheese Plate and two dozen roses.  When we arrived none of the items I ordered were  in the room.  The staff couldn't find any record of the items I had ordered even though my credit card had been charged for all of the above.   It took two hours for them to rectify the error and the management did not offer any apology for the concierge's mistake.  This was the start to the worst romantic getaway I ever experienced.Choose another hotel for your stay in Charleston.  At checkin we were told our room wasn't ready even though checkin is guaranteed at 3:00pm and it was 5:00 pm.  We waited another thirty minutes for our room.  No apologies were offered to us.  The only comment was "we had a lot of check outs today".  Upon entering the room there wasn't any towels in the bathroom nor toiletries.   It took another thirty minutes for our luggage to arrive in our room.  The mattress was lumpy and worn out.  The linens on the bed were thread bare.  The Days Inn would have been a step up from this hotel.Although the rooms were spacious we had a view of a brick wall.  Maybe that is why we could never receive the WIFI signal.  Our in room safe didn't work and there was nobody working in maintenance to fix the safe.  When we made the reservation it was explained that I am highly allergic to feathers.  There were feather pillows in the room.  The room smelled like cigarette smoke.  We were told there were no other rooms available and they couldn't move us.  My trip was spent at the ER with a severe migraine from the down pillows and cigarette smoke.We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference. I have to say, normally I am very easy going about amenities, cleanliness, and the like...however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review. Truly, DO NOT stay at this hotel. When we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. I figuered, "okay, it's just the carpet." Until I saw the bathroom! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, I kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things "appear" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well, the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly, I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this. When I got home, I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. Please, do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel."
"I've stayed at other hotels in Chicago, but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience. First off the staff was incredibly rude. I could have lived with that being that it was busy, but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out. The room was also horrid. It smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that I was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair. There was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain. Mark my words: Never again will I stay at this dump!"
"What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare. The first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they couldn't find my reservation. Add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked. The internet service was so slow it was unusable. To top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible. Finally, I discovered the valet parking, which was a $49 premium service, dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car. I highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit Chicago."
"The Ambassador East Hotel is a terrible place to stay. All of the rooms are old and dirty as though they haven't been cleaned or remodeled for years. The hotel staff is not friendly or accomodating. Do not waste your money in this crappy old hotel full of rude employees."
"The Ambassador East is a particularly crappy property, given the numerous quality hotels in and around the Gold Coast. Unfortunately, I saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. While the lobby was gorgeous (and appears to match the photos on the website) the room I was assigned was run down, and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. It looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls, but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. The room also smelled of must or mildew. While the room did have air-conditioning as advertised, it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. I was only here for a single night, but had I been here for anywhere longer I would have requested a refund. Please, if you're staying in this part of town, do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. The Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn are both nearby, clean, and often have special-offers -- these aren't the only properties in the area, but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay."
"During my recent trip to Chicago, I stayed at the Ambassador East hotel, which is located in the downtown are. I have to say I was not pleased with my stay there. For one, I had requested that my room have one king sized bed when I called for reservations, however, when I arrived, the hotel lobby clerk said they did not have any king sized beds left and I had to settle with two double sized beds. When I told the clerk that a king sized was promised when i made the reservation, he just shrugged his shoulders. When I got to my room, I found it to be very small. There was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room. There wasn't, although I did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed. At night, there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel. I did not figure what the convention was for, but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise. I called the front desk several times complaining about the noise. Each time they assured me they would deal with the noise, but the racket never dissipated and I finally gave up getting any sleep. I did go back to the lobby before my trip ended to complain of the poor service that they have given me, the manager said that she felt sorry for the trouble I had been having at the hotel, but did not offer any refund or consolation for the trouble. When I left the Ambassador East, I vowed that if I ever returned to Chigaco, I would never stay at this place again."
"My husband and I recently went to Chicago for my Aunt's funeral. We are not familiar with the area so we asked for recommedations of where to stay for the two nights we would be in town. We were told to stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. I wish we could say that our experience there was a good one, but sadly, it was one of of the more disappointing travel experiences we have had. Upon check in we were quickly shown to our rooms, but when we entered our king suite a very strong, musty smell greeted us on the other side. At first I thought I was just being sensitive, but after about an hour in the room we simply had to request to be moved. The smell was too overwhelming. The front desk said they would be happy to move us, but the only other room available was a suite with two double beds, rather than the king bed suite we originally reserved. While this was not exactly what we wanted, we didn't really have a choice to refuse. After transfering to the new room and getting settled, we discovered that the electrical outlet near the sink in the bathroom did not work. While this did not bother my husband too much, I was very annoyed, as I need the mirror while I use my hair dryer, curling iron, etc. I absolutely did not want to have to switch rooms yet again, so I simply had to make due with doing my hair next to the bed. They also only gave us two towels of any kind in the bathroom, so we had to request washcloths and small hand towels, BOTH DAYS we were there! Each time the housekeeping staff seemed incredibly annoyed at these requests. For what we paid to stay at this hotel, we were not impressed at all. The customer service was lackluster and the rooms were not up to par. If you are ever in Chicago, do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else."
"I had heard good things about the Ambassador East and decided to stay there on vacation with my husband -- what a mistake! First off, they charge for being able to use the internet, which should be a given these days, especially for how much you pay for the room. The "champagne" was cheap , I could have spent $15 to get my own bottle. The King room was just as small as a double room anyway. The bed was really hard, and crudely made. Maybe there was someone new on the staff that didn't know how to make a bed, but besides that, the sheets were starched to military stiffness. It was so uncomfortable! When I asked if we might get some new sheets, the staff were so incredibly rude and told me I was basically stuck with what I had because they're "all that way". I was appalled! Anyway, we gave it a shot and stayed there that night, in the mediocre luster of the room design. We didn't sleep well and didn't particularly enjoy ourselves, especially because apparently there was a wedding going on in the building because we could hear the party! I mean, talk about the opposite of peaceful! Again, we tried appealing to the staff to have our room moved away from the party, but they said they couldn't move us because of the romance package. What a jip! After the kind of "fun" we'd had, we realized we couldn't handle anymore. We called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours. We wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay, and he said he'd do that, but that we'd still be charged a percentage of it! After telling him everything that had happened and how displeased we were, we finally got him to not charge us and left to go stay at another hotel that was actually relaxing."
"I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel this past summer for 5 days and it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had! Firstly, the sheets that were on the bed seemed as if they were the same ones the previous guests had left on there; they looked dingy or just plain dirty. Second, I went to function one night and came back in late so I was really tired the next morning, hence I slept in late. I put the "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door and the room service still came knocking down my door asking if they can come and clean. Obviously, the room service lady can't read. Third, and worst of them all, when I checked I was only allowed valet parking so I gave up my keys hoping to get back my car in one piece. Well, the next morning when I asked for my car to be retrieved, there was a big dent in the driver's door of my 2010 Mustang! I was livid and the valet guy was insisting that he got it like that. In the end I had to get my door repaired on my own! The only thing I liked there was the food and it wasn't even all that. I was so disappointed and so I'm warning everyone to think twice before you make a reservation."
"I booked a room at this hotel expecting great accommodations considering the price but was disappointed. The room looked nice, but I found that there weren't any extra blankets in the closet and the heating system was dysfunctional. I came back to the room after a meeting and found that it still had not been cleaned even though it was the late afternoon. I asked for replacement towels and they were very late in coming. I would have expected there to be a shuttle of some sort to the airport, especially since the website advertises the close distance. Instead, I had to call for a taxi and was almost late for my plane because the taxi was stuck in traffic. All in all, not the best experience at all."
"I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel, I really did. It seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access. I arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon. I was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in. I could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck, doing nothing. As I walked in, nobody greeted me, and nobody offered to take my bags. The hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated, with a fine covering of dust. I went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys, all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer. I got to my room, and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking, there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway. Having paid extra for an upgraded room, I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside. The drinking glasses were filthy, the towels smelled of mold, and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can. The television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old, and there was no channel guide, though I suppose I didn't need one for the six channels that it had. I had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel, but alas, there was no respite here. The room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive, and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done. Elsewhere in the hotel things were no better. Everywhere I went, from the pool to the bar, the staff was hasty, rude, and completely uninterested, and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated. I really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel, but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out."
"I recently stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for two night, and my visit was nothing short of disappointing. Expecting to have a wonderfully romantic weekend with my fiance, we specifically chose this hotel because we prefer boutique hotels for the extra attention from the staff and unique atmosphere. Our expectations for the Ambassador were not met. The room was small and, frankly, outdated. The bathroom smelled musty. The A/C in the room had two settings: polar cold or off. The walls did nothing to muffle sound from adjacent rooms, and it was loud at night - a good night's sleep was impossible. Staff were indifferent. Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. Frankly, it's not worth the steep price and mediocre character. Since there are far better and more accommodating boutique hotels in Chicago, I know I won't be back at this place."
"During my stay at the Hilton Chicago it has been quite unpleasant. How so you might ask? Well ill tell you, the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible I mean they weren't even at the desk when I checked in. Also, When I ordered my breakfast, lunch, and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. Finally, The bill was charging me for stuff I didn't want or ask for. But overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. I give it a half a star."
"This hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat. The first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket. This place looks alright in the lobby, but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in Chicago, this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night. Clearly the Ambassador East Hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession. Not to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic. Chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached, particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call."
"My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel last month for my son's wedding. When we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to Valet our car. After waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip, which I found rude. After finally getting to our room I noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom. I was extremely disappointed with the room and the service. I will not recommend this place to anyone."
"My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Ambassador East Hotel. We will never stay at this hotel again. For the steep price we paid to stay there, we expected a friendly staff and clean room, which we did not get. First of all, the rooms are not clean. We found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed. When we reported this information to the hotel staff, they did not do anything to help us out. The staff is very unfriendly. Also, there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom."
"My wife and I stayed at the Abassador East Hotel in August to attend the Air and Water Show in Chicago. I called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. Upon arrival at the hotel, not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasn't even a single king as was requested. Apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. The room itself was small and underwhelming. The was not dirty, but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. The hotel was packed the weekend we visited. The staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. The concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. The hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. The main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult! Luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable. We will not be staying at the Abassador on future trips. Hopefully, current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe..."
"when we arrived the check in process was fairly quick, however the staff seemed in a bad mood all around. they seemed as if we were taking up their time. when we got to the room we tried to use our personal computer to look for attractions, and after having to pay $10 a day for wifi it was a total waste of money the speed of the internet was extremely slow. the free workout area was also not up to our expectations but since it was free we didnt complain. overall we would never stay at this hotel again and we do not recommend it."
"The Ambassador Hotel is located in Downtown Chicago right off Lakeshore Drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown. I would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown. The rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay, when in fact, we had a pretty unpleasant experience. It started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in. I have no problem with this, except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him. After checking in, we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed. The pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms, they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way. The beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows, they took over an hour to arrive. I will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future."
"The Ambassador East Hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart. As i was staying for a few nights I notied may problems with the service of this expensive,cold hotel.First the room sevice was poorly helpful, the bag boy insisted on a tip, and also droped my bag. The chefs cooking was terriable,the steak that I spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare, but came to me burnt. The room was not what you pay for, the beds were like a sack of rocks. And to top it off the covers smelled like smoke. I will never give the Ambassador East Hotel another chance."
"I will never use Ambassador East Hotel again. The first appearance you get is a very dark and dreary type setting. The exterior of the hotel was in desperate need of repair. The customer service was not as good as you would expect when spending your hard earned money on a hotel room. In this hotel you are spending more than the average amount of money on a room that is smaller than the average hotel room. I felt rushed out at check out and didn't have an enjoyable experience at all."
"Stayed at this hotel for labor day weekend and it was pretty awful. The staff were relatively friendly, but that's where the positive aspects stop. Bed was rock hard and VERY uncomfortable. Thermostat didn't work properly and the air conditioner was always 5 degrees warmer or colder than what you wanted. Even though I think $10 for 1 day of internet is RIDICULOUS, I bought it because I needed to download a powerpoint for work and send off a few emails. It was UNGODLY slow and barely better than dialup. I ended up finding a starbucks to use their wifi so I could actually get something done. Minibar was overpriced, as expected. Awful experience, definitely wouldn't stay here again."
"My experience at the Ambassador East Hotel was truly terrible. I went to Chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. This hotel was recommended by the wedding party. It was a terrible choice. Despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. The staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. My kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. The place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. My son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. Overall, I would say I was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. On the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. Still, I would not return here again."
"I stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago. That was the last time I will be staying there. When I arrived, I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. They wanted at least $10. What am I paying for when I stay there for the night? The website also touted the clean linens. The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. The problem was with all of the down pillows etc. Don't they know that people have allergies? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. I think that this was another part of my symptoms. If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. Beware hidden costs. I will try somewhere else in the future. Not worth the money or the sneezing all night."
"We originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website, read about their "romantic weekend getaway." Having never been in the area before or stayed at an Ambassador Hotel we really didn't know what to expect, but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be. Upon arriving, the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car, unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic. It only went downhill from there. The bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldn't figure out what it was. We ended up getting a different room, which was very mediocre. Needless to say, we won't be staying here again."
"The Hard Rock should stick to restaurants. After a recent stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago I think they should go back to what there good at. Besides having to wait an hour for my room to be ready (this is after my check in time), the receptionist was very rude and seemed to not care that I was being delayed. After seeing the state the room was in I still do not understand what took so long. The sheets look to have been picked up off the floor and returned to the bed. The bathroom looked as if somebody had just used it (I will leave out the details). Complaining didn't seem to get me anywhere, they offered me a small discount at the hotel's bar. After this experience I will be more likely to book at a Motel 6 then return to the Hard Rock."
"The name "Hard Rock" might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here. The website alludes to musicians and parties but if you're looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the Hard Rock falls short. The hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this. The service is mediocre and the rooms aren't clean. I stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in Chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun, exciting romance. I should have picked somewhere else. Save your money."
"Hi, I had very bad experience with this hotel, as the rooms had bad smell and very dim light. the bed sheets were not properly cleaned. Also the carpet was dirty though AC was working properly. But i would nor recommend this hotel to my friends as it did not satisfied me. There was a problem with hot and cold water in the bathroom. Please do not go to this hotel, it seems very nice from the pictures and all but in actual its different."
"This was my first time staying at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago and I have nothing but hate for the entire experience. The building itself is maintained, however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill. And while the outside appearance is fine and dandy, my room 325, was repulsive. As soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room's ground and verbally demanded a tip, I noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around, the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement, before I could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled. Immediately I went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour, a complete waste of time, because as soon as I had reported my problem I was told that no other rooms were available and I would have to make do, they did however say I could stay the night free of charge. The next morning as I was set to leave I decided I would try the breakfast, in hopes of finding one redeeming quality. Let me tell you, that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold, the worst breakfast I have ever had in my entire life. Overall the employees are arrogant and callous, with the work ethic of a 2 year old child, they cannot cook, the room for me was poorly maintained, however they are good at refunding your money."
"I stayed at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago last year and can say i was not satisfied with my experience. I feel that it didn't live up to what was advertised and the accommodations were sub-par at best. I had the chance to catch a show and the music was too loud and the sound guy's work resembled that of an amateur. My personal rating is 2/5 stars and i would not recommend this hotel to a friend."
"I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, Il. From the start, the experience was bad. The room was filthy, there were no towels, and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation. I will never stay there again. I could not have been more dissatisfied."
"For 250 dollars, cheapest room available at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago, you would assume you would have access to wifi. Yet, that was not the case. I was told I "could have had" internet if I had booked through the site, which I didnt. The lady in the reception had no idea what she was talking about and had to ask around about internet access in general."
"What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster. The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in...they knew we had 6! We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel. When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other. After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor, unfortunately one of the rooms hadn't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am. Despite my calls to the front desk, the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. We also didn't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly. One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door. I understand they allow pets, but really...people need to clean up after their animals...or have some dog free floors. While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms, their service was terrible, the staff was rude, and I still can't get over that dog poo in the hallway. I definitely won't be staying here again."
"The hard rock hotel Chicago is not as good as they try to portray, First ill start off by saying there website is confusing and hard to navigate through. They also have rude customer service, that dont seem happy to answer your questions. There prices are so outrageously expensive for what they offer, its just ridiculous. Hard rock hotel has a good rep behind there name, but Hard rock hotel Chicago should not be included in that."
"The Hilton Chicago, located on prime real estate in downtown Chicago, has not aged as gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time. The hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic, but that luxury is not in accord with 21st century standards. Lacking any form of fitness center, the Hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of Chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout. Even nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this point, and the outrageous parking fee of $43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making the Hilton their destination. Most guest rooms are no different than any other Hilton anywhere, meaning that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic Executive suites, you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience."
"My husband and I stayed here at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago a few months back. I wasn't particularly impressed with their customer service. When we arrived to check in, the front desk clerk was quite rude and unfriendly. She was short with me when I asked her about the city's attractions and things to do. Our room wasn't all that great either. It was rather small and had a weird smell to it. I won't be staying here again."
"I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a convention I was attending. This was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations. Check-in took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. Once I did get into my room, there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room. I went down to the front desk and requested a room change. Given their computer problems, that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didn't have the "positive attitude in spite of any difficulty" I'd expect from such a high profile establishment. The new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling. When I hooked up my laptop, I was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service. I had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies, but as part of their computer problems, the wi-fi service was down. Fortunately, there was a Starbucks up the street with available wi-fi. Granted, I couldn't lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room, but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices. I was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. However, the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. A quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks. They did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer's DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated. Once I had a chance to relax in the room, there were a few minor details that stood out. The carpet was starting to get worn in places, the edges on some of the furniture was dinged, and my personal pet peeve... the inside of the drawers were rough, unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes. I would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel. But, all things considered, my stay was tolerable. Water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep. The wi-fi was still down in the morning so I checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at Starbucks."
"Hard Rock Hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays. What they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be. The service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons, service is more redily available and friendly the more you make.The rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings. The laundry service leaves more to be desired. The sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco. I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the bedding.Your stay at any hotel should be memorable and restful-after all isnt that what we pay for?"
"I have visited Chicago with my family several times and have never had such a HORRIBLE hotel experience! The staff was rude and unhelpful, and they overcharged my card by more than $300! I had to spend the whole morning on the phone trying to get them to finally fix their mistake. The hotel itself didn't live up to our expectations either...the inside was dingy and needed cleaning, and our room looked like a bunch of chain smokers had just thrown a crazy party in the room. There were cigarette burns on the sheets, stains on the floor, and there was a hole in the wall where it looked like someone had punched it! We requested another room, which was only marginally better in terms of cleanliness, only to be kept up all night from the noise of our neighbors yelling and hanging out in the hallway. There are plenty of other places to stay in Chicago. AVOID Hard Rock at all costs!"
"I would not reccomend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep. I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for two nights this past July. I had a select king city view room. The room was dark, with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view. I was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow. The hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long, so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there. When I called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did. I ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door. They quieted down for about an hour, but then were loud again for the rest of the night. The hotel was expensive, and for the price there weren't very many special amenities. There was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $10 a day. Overall I would not recommend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago, as it is way overpriced for what you get."
"I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online. However, my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations. When I arrived, well over an hour of check in time, I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in. The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs, and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd, there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down (after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue). As I am a fairly light sleeper, I woke up several times throughout the night. I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep. Overall the hotel looked very nice, but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room."
"While the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago promises upscale accommodations and a unique experience, they fail to deliver. Unless of course, a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door. If you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed. The "A" list celebrities will not be there. In fact, it would be rare to find anyone on the "B" list either. The party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert. The party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar. The walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played. As for the promise of Art Deco, it must have changed in definition. Your room will truly look like a concert has just been held. The carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer. The bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description. Quality service and amenities were severely lacking. Guests are not greeted with warmth but with disdain. Do not bother complaining about the noise next door either. It is part of you unique experience. The only part of the Hard Rock Hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in Chicago. It was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip."
"I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago during Labor day weekend, huge mistake! When I got to my room everything seemed okay,Until I went into the bathroom. There was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard I turned the knob, it would not stop. There was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper. It also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as I saw a wad of hair, and scraps of tissue behind the bowl. I called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it. While I was waiting I turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there.... the a.c. started blowing out hot, musky air and had the room smelling horrible. I made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room. They told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator. I was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip I was hearing I had no choice but to take it. When I moved to the new room, there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on. Front desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later, I was able to relax and settle in. Hard Rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason, I will not be staying there again."
"I was really excited when we booked a night at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. It was actually beyond our budget, but my husband and I needed a weekend away, so I decided to splurge for the occasion. WORST WASTE OF MY MONEY EVER!!! Our room was smaller than pictured online, and it looked like the maid didn't vacuum the carpet! We visited the hotel restaurant, Angels and Kings, one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husband's steak was cooked wrong (he ordered medium, but received a well-done steak). By the end of our trip we were so glad to leave, but they were under-staffed and the Sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out. Chicago was a fun city, but next time we return I'll be choosing a different hotel - and I suggest you do too!!"
"A few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. The hotel was a bust from the get go. As we arrived in the lobby, we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up. (We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes.) When she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful. We had to wander around the halls looking for our room. Once we got to our room, we thought the weekend was going to get better. The rooms are modern and nicely designed. That was about all that this hotel had going for it though. As soon as we started to explore the room more, it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before. The bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it. We called a worker and they cleaned most of it up, but the thought of it still remained. As we all settled down to sleep, there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door. After about an hour, we finally made a call to the front desk to complain. The woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in Chicago. They were staying there the next 2 nights. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone! It's a hard rock hotel all right. (At least that's what the beds feel like!)"
"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July. For a "luxury" hotel this place did not meet my expectations. For starters, we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn't be ready for at least another hour! I'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee. Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel's restaurants, Kitty O'Sheas. Well, we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks. Once we finally got to our room it was OK, although not great for the price. We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view, and there were not extra towels as I had requested. We had to call room service twice to receive them, then another two times because our air conditioner wasn't working. Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone. Next time I'm in the Chicago area I won't be staying at the Hilton. I'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money."
"Hotel is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud, it is hard to sleep during the night because all the "city"noises coming from the outside. The rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures. I stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband, and we supposed to get room with king size bad, but instead we got, two single beds. The stuff isn't really very nice either, they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you."
"My recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was miserable. My visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation. I had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me "in the system". We finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. That process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. The room that I had originally reserved (King) was not available and I had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a Double room. I was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that I decided to stay in and order room service. It took an hour and a half for my food to arrive. When finally delivered, it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it. So now I am cranky, tired and starving! I ate what I could from the mini bar (poor selection of items) and went to bed. The room was spacious but had a stale smell to it, as if someone had smoked in it. The next morning I complained and wanted to change rooms. The woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way. I decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Chicago. I will never waste my time or money at The Talbott again."
"The Talbott is definitely not worth the price you pay. I was really looking forward to staying here since it was recently renovated & was in a good location. Unfortunately, it just didn't live up to the hype. "Recently renovated" apparently means it was redone in the last decade, not the last year. It was just very tired-looking. Also very disappointing was the food, and the service was hit or miss. I expected better from a hotel of this caliber. Bottom line, there are better places with better value. Stay elsewhere."
"We chose the Talbott Hotel primarily for the location, but quickly discovered that the location was the only good thing about it. Although their website did a good job of selling their services and amenities, we found both severely lacking. We had mentioned to the reservationist when booking that this was to be a romantic weekend getaway for us - it was our anniversary. We asked for, and were promised, a king room. However, when we checked in, we were told by the front desk clerk that no king rooms were available. We could either take a double queen room, or pay significantly more for a suite. We took the key for our double queen room and were on our way. Upon arriving on our floor, we found a rowdy group of young girls running up and down the hallway, squealing and playing. It turns out that this hotel offers American Girl visits for the nearby store. It turns out that our romantic getaway room was in the center of a block of rooms reserved for a Girl Scout troop on an American Girl trip! We went back downstairs to request a move to another room, and were told no other double queen rooms were currently available. We explained that we were here for our anniversary, and the ambiance wasn't exactly what we were looking for. The clerk rolled her eyes and told us that she couldn't help us - they didn't have anything else. Sorry. Back upstairs we went. Tired from travel, we decided to order from room service for dinner. Our pasta, when it arrived, was barely warm and mediocre in flavor. We ate it anyway and prepared for bed. After using the bathroom, we discovered that the toilet in our room continued to cycle water after flushing. After jiggling the handle a few times and poking around in the tank, we couldn't get the water to stop running. It took three hours for a maintenance staff member to make their way up to our room to fix the problem. The next morning, after showering, I discovered the hair dryer didn't work properly. After pulling my wet hair back in a clip, we went out for the day. Upon our return, we expected to find our room made up and fresh. It hadn't been touched. We called downstairs to have someone sent up to clean it, but by the time we'd left for dinner, nobody had arrived. Our room wasn't made up that day. That night, the Girl Scouts sat in the hallway giggling and singing until well after 1am. We asked them several times to be quiet, but they didn't want to listen, and their chaperones were nowhere to be seen. We called down to the desk, and they told us "they would take care of it", but the girls continued to have their party in the hallway anyway. Nobody came to shoo them away. The next morning, I turned on the hairdryer, expecting it to work after reporting the difficulty the day before. It didn't! Stuck wearing my clip again, we checked out and made a mental note to select another hotel in the area for our next trip. This hotel had potential, but the staff doesn't care enough about your experience to allow me to recommend it to other travelers."
"I recently stayed in a room at the trendy Talbott Hotel. It looked nice on the outside so I decided to them a whirl. As soon as I walked in I noticed that there weren't alot of hotel employees. Usually, the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand. I was tired and I needed a nice room so as I approached the front desk I noticed something odd. Food was sitting out right in front of the front desk. People were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush. Crumbs everywhere especially where I was suppose to exchange cash and room keys. Let's just say it wasn't professional. The room was average and the bathroom didn't carry the kinds of brands I would have liked to see. No Wi-Fi connection and I had to walk down the hall for ice. Talk about lack of customer service. All in all, the stay was sub-par and nothing special."
"The staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding, dong, ditch. The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay. The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap, but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room."
"The Talbott Hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome. If you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel. The room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside. The cost is far more than the luxury. The best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels."
"For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor (think Motel 6 at a Hilton price). Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin. They are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks, so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of. For the prices they charge ($350.average price for two people). It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby, which was happening while I stayed, could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms. But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests, which I won't be."
"My daughter's broken heart My daughter loves American Girl and for her birthday wanted to go to American Girl Doll in Chicago. For six months my eight year old counted day the day until we left for Chicago when she could have the experience of a lifetime. We arrived at the Talbot Hotel where we had reserved the American Doll Girl package only to find out that they had given our room away and that they were going to move us across town. If that wasn't bad enough we had to spend an hour to find out if the American Girl carriage ride had been canceled or if we should book another one. My daughter sulked for most of the trip as we spent more time going from thing to thing instead of being able to walk. My daughter cried herself to sleep the first night and I could tell that her heart was broken."
"I booked my reservations at The Talbott Hotel in hopes of finding luxury and excellent service. What I actually got was far less than that. When I first arrived to check in, the woman at the desk was very impolite and looked rather bored. It took her over 5 minutes to even find my reservation in the computer system! And I won't go into detail about how she messed up with my room keys and had to give me a second set! When I finally got to my room, the first thing I noticed was that it smelled stale. The air in the room literally smelled like it had been in that room, without any fresh air, for years. I soon discovered my bathroom toilet had a leak, as well, and every time you flushed the toilet, water would trickle out from the base onto the floor. Talk about concerning. I reported this to the desk, and the fellow who answered promised someone would be up right away to fix it. No one showed up until the next day, and very early in the morning, I might add. Later, I called room service and asked for a bottle of wine. It took them half an hour to deliver it to my room! And it wasn't even chilled by the time it showed up, either; it was lukewarm. Overall, my experience here was not very pleasant, and I don't recommend booking with this hotel."
"The Hilton Chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel. There are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms, Lakeside view or suites. It only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill. You will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return! The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff. The casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap. Next time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere."
"For all the hype and rave reviews of the Talbott Hotel, it seemed to me that it would be a mistake to NOT stay there, not the other way around. The Talbott Hotel website claims to have "opulent accommodations, impeccable service, and unexpected delights." The last time I checked, "opulent" had a bit of a different meaning than "easily outdone by the senile 90-year-old landlord of your college apartment," "impeccable" wasn't code for "rude and unfriendly," and "unexpected delights" were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel. Overall, my stay here simply wasn't worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations. For a lot less,I could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment."
"WARNING! My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels. I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends. After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott. They were promoting up to $30 breakfast credit per day. And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time. Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee (which we wouldn't have known had he not told us) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group. Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved. If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6, not a luxury hotel in Chicago. The linens were stained, room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee. I was truly disgusted. After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep. The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests. I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten. The toast was stale, eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs, and the juice they served was sour. I would never recommend this as a place to stay. I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime."
"I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago. I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago's exciting night life. I found The Talbott Hotel's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for. The price sounded reasonable, so I booked a room. The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. We arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that Friday afternoon. After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. They blamed this on shortage of maids that day. They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. This disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. We managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again? Probably not."
"Terrible time at The Talbott. When I planned my vacation to Chicago I called ahead and made reservations to stay here. When I went to check in I was told I didn't have a reservation, knowing my credit card was charged I argued with the guy who was working. Finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else. Thankfully they knew how to use the computer. I go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet. I could not believe it when I complained, I was told to spray some air freshener. I had to go visit family. When I got back my room key did not work. Once again there I was complaining to the helpless employee. He told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet. I could not believe the mentality of this guy. I had one more night reserved, I could not take it anymore and I went and spent the rest of my vacation at my Aunts house. I would not recommend The Talbott to anyone."
"I was going on a 3 day personal trip to Chicago, and I decided to indulge myself a bit this time around. I chose to stay at the Talbot, an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. To start off, I was NOT pleased. For the hundreds I pay a day, I expected an impeccable hotel. First, the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance. Some customer service they claim. Next, when I went to my room, I found that room service had not cleaned it at all. I was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such. In summary: yes, it was a fancy hotel, yes it had nice accommodations, but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price."
"After a recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago, I left the city with an empty pocket book. I had booked a package deal online and although the service was absolutely terrific, i didn't realize some of the amenities i was paying for included personalized key cards and room service menus. I could have done with out my room key having my name printed across it as well as the menu. When did my name printed on things become an extra amenity that cost so much money? I basically felt overcharged for the so called 'extras' included in the package i purchased. One other thing, the traffic was pretty horrible and checking in seems like it could have somehow been made simpler."
"My husband and I were planning our 1st year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in Chicago where we had first met. After spending several minutes frustratingly navigating The Talbott Hotel's website, I FINALLY was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend. After a long flight into Chicago, we were so ready to check in, shower, and lay down in our hotel room. However, once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation. I provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied. She begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting. We then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door. I'm severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel."
"I recently stayed at The Talbott Hotel for 3 nights and I could not have been more disappointed. It was a terrible experience. Long wait to check into room since room wasn't ready even though I arrived way after the check in time. Front desk was very rude. Was given a smoking room when I had requested non-smoking. Room service left a lot to be desired. The food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing. The staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly. Had no toilet paper in room. Room was very noisy. Could hear people next door opening doors, watching tv, talking. The room was very dingy, small and had a musty odor. Needless to say I will not be staying here again nor will I be recommending this hotel to anyone else. Stay away from this hotel. Not worth the money."
"I'd expect a "luxury" hotel to pay more attention to details. The room really hadn't been thoroughly cleaned-- I found hairballs under the bed, the mirrors were streaked, etc. The desk staff took forever to even acknowledge me when I was checking in; three of them, two on the phone, and nobody even made eye contact for 5 minutes. Then, they gave the vaguest answers to some pretty basic questions about the neighborhood; you'd think they'd know where to find a Starbucks. The internet was ridiculously slow the whole two days I was there."
"I selected The Talbott for my recent family vacation to Chicago. We chose the hotel for it's close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location. In retrospect, the phrase "location, location, location" apparently does not apply to hotels. It's a good thing the location was so great, because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad. Upon our arrival, our room was not ready. The clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation, and told us simply that "we would have to wait" without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. When we finally arrived in the room, the sheets were not clean. A call to housekeeping proved difficult, as I do not speak Spanish. The second day of our trip, housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our "please service" sign hung on the door. We stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave. When the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order, it was cold and not very good. Despite these poor impressions, the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout. My call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in Mumbai. They will not receive my business again."
"My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton. We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work. Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for. First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos. The floors looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while in the check in area. The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side. The staff was horrible. We had asked for a turn down service it was never received. I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone. Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton."
"The Talbott Hotel claims to be Chicago's Premiere Small Luxury Hotel. After staying there and experiencing the service, environment, and the hotel in general, I can say with confidence that this just isn't true. I arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed. No one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself. The doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me, leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags. Once inside, the atmosphere was not what I expected. The lighting was poor, leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building. The carpet looked dirty, as if it hadn't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time, and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage. When I arrived at the front desk, I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me. After checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed. The bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water. That night I ordered room service. The food took 45 minutes to get to my room, and when it finally arrived it was cold. The fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them. I would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends, and probably not to my enemies either. Stay away!"
"The Conrad Chicago hotel had some of the worst service I have ever dealt with. I got the Executive Room with a king size bed. When I got in, the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud. I called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me. They have a pillow menu which I tried to select from but they were out of over half of them. The Ipod dock was not working either. Also, the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm. This hotel is the worst in Chicago and I would never recommend going there!"
"The name Conrad (the most luxurious of all Hilton hotels) should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury; however, the Conrad in Chicago, IL did obviously not receive the memo. Upon entering the hotel, we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff. Additionally, we were not offered any help. The desk receptionist was beyond rude. Her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay. After getting our card, we were finally offered help with our luggage. The young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage. Strangely, he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip. He received the tip he deserved, which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away. Upon first looking at the room it was beautiful. However, closer inspection revealed that the room had NOT been cleaned since the last visitor had left. There was hair in the sink and around the toilet. There was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub. This fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff. Instead, I was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards. Two-hours later, someone came into the room to "investigate". When they saw the mess that had been left, they offered a menial apology. Still another two hours later, housekeeping arrived. The level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage. In the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit, the valet actually brought the wrong car to me. I was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me (it was certainly an incredible make and model), but my better judgment prevailed. I informed the valet of his mistake, to which he replied, "Sorry dude, I read your ticket wrong." I know that he did not smoke in my car, but he smelled so strongly of smoke, that the smell melted into my seat. Luckily, its location on Rush will help get out of the terror that is Conrad Chicago. There are so many better hotels in Chicago -- please spend your money elsewhere."
"Overpriced is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel. While it may be in downtown Chicago, the room had no view. Although I asked for non-smoking, the room reeked of smoke. The elevators were very slow, and one was not working during my stay. There was a stain on the pillow, and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken. There was a dead bug in the bath tub. I was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay. My credit card was billed twice, and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge. I do not recommend this hotel at all!"
"This hotel is rather far from the airport and in traffic it took almost 2 hours to get there. By that time, I was so tired I was just ready to check in to my room. I stood in line forever as there was only one person working at the front desk. That was only the beginning. It was very noisy outside from people constantly walking around. I guess it's because they're located in the middle of the downtown area, but they could at least make the walls thicker. I don't want to hear everything going on in my neighbor's room. The bathroom was not very clean and one of the towels had a hole in it. The toilet ran all night which kept me up along with all the people on the street. The restaurant food was horrible and I would rather buy food from a street vendor than to pay the ridiculously high price they charged for a burger. Overall, I was very disappointed with my stay at the Conrad Chicago."
"Chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers. When visiting the Windy City, however, the Conrad Hotel and Resort is one to avoid. While the description promises clean accommodations, luxury amenities, and "deep soaking tubs," in relity, the rooms fall short of expectations. I opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet. A bit disappointed, I decided to ignore this fact. Hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels, I made my way to the bathroom. While I did find a large, deep bathtub, there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. Hardly what I expected for the price I paid for the accommodations. In the corner of the bathroom, I found a reminder of a pevious guest, a clump of blond hair. The maid service seemed to be lacking. Not to be deterred from enjoying my stay, I decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen I had been promised. Unfortunately, the battery to the remote control was dead. I called the front desk, at my wits' end, to complain about the issues, but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word. Overall, I would definitely not recommend the Conrad Hotel and Resort in Chicago. My room was dirty, the staff was unfriendly, and the ammenities were few and far between. On my next stay in Chicago, I will definitely stay elsewhere."
"What a disappointment this hotel was. First, the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in. When we finally got up to our room, we opened the door and found someone else was already in it! Yes, the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else's room. We went back to the clerk who checked us in (skipping the still present line, which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting) and told him the problem. However, he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us. He did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do. This took a *very* long time. It was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back. He said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view. The hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these, but when we got to this new room, we found out why these rooms hadn't been taken. The room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel. We briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel, but it was late already so we just decided to make do. That was, of course, until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down. Then somewhere around 7:30am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beep-beep backup sound and all sorts of other noise. So much for a good night's sleep. I suppose I should say the room itself looked nice, but with all the noise from the loading dock, who cares. We gave up and checked out that morning to find another hotel. Definitely not going back here ever again."
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights, a Thursday through Saturday. Let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. We chose to stay in the "King Bed Deluxe Room" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. Upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. The room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. The major annoyance was how loud people were. We came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. That is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. You can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. The service was also extremely sub par. We had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. One day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. She completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. It scared me and I'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing. So to sum up, we will never stay at the Conrad again, we will never recommend it to anyone else, and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago."
"My wife and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago Hilton a few weeks back. I had a conference in the Windy City, and my wife decided she'd come along to do some shopping. First off let me say, typically I LOVE staying in hotels - any chance I get, i'll spend it away from home in a comfy hotel bed. That said, this place was terrible. The room had a slight odor to it, kind of a fishy smell. The people at the front desk were rude to us. And I found a soiled pair of women's panties under the bed. Gross! Not to mention that once we got home, we both had bug bites up and down our legs--- now we're worried we brought bedbugs home with us! If I could take this trip back I would. What a terrible place. Shame on you Conrad Hilton, shame on you!"
"I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance. However, I later learned that I had made a poor choice. Upon arrival, the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk. Although, when we reached out hotel room, we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite. My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds. The clerk, after a twenty minute waiting period, was able to find us a suitable room. Upon entering, the room was noticably hot. We turned on the air conditioning, and after waiting for thirty minutes, the room remained muggy and humid. I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room. They promised a repairman within ten minutes. 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman hadn't shown up. They once again promised a speedy repair. While waiting, I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp. I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level, but I had to go get them. After all this trouble, I argued that they should bring it up to me, but in the end, I wound up going to get it myself. After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes, the repair man had not shown up. So I called again, and within 5 minutes the repairman came. He managed to fix the air conditioner, but it was about 12am. We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off, but as the night went on, we noticed another problem. The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds. It also emitted a strange odor. Upon checking with the front desk, we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired. There were not available rooms left, and being so fed up with this hotel's poor service, we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel. I don't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time."
"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a recent business trip. I elected to go with their Executive Suite upgrade. All I can say is, "What upgrade?" It's barely anything above what you get normally. And for the price I paid, I was expecting much better acommodations. Because I arrived around 10:30 the night I checked in (delayed flight) I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. I find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. Beyond that, it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. First it was a room mix-up, then it was a missing key card. That was extremely frustrating as I was tired and I had a presentation to give the next morning. Speaking of the next morning, the complimentary breakfast was a joke. When I just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast, I'll stay at the next Super 8 I find. And the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed. I will not be staying at the Hilton Chicago every again even though I frequent Chicago. This tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot."
"For our anniversary this year, my wife and I stayed at the Conrad. We're from the suburbs, so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us. It's expensive, so we expect the best for our money. This was most definitely not the best for our money. It wasn't even a good deal either. The problems began right off the bat. When we got to our room, we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room. It was like walking into a dusty attic. When I sat down to watch TV, it turns out it wasn't even connected to cable or anything. I kept changing the channel, but it was nothing but static and white noise. I even looked for another remote. After we left our things, we went out for a night in Chicago, but coming back, the smell seemed to have gotten worse. I finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms. They moved us to a different room, but they had no explanation for the smell. For a single stay, that was more trouble than it was worth."
"Don't ever stay at this hotel!, Conrad Chicago is the worst hotel you can imagine. First of all, THE PRICE! you not get what you pay for. I paid &217.50 one night for a room that did not even had a TV!! that's ridiculous! The bathroom did not work, and it was nasty! the bed sheets seemed like used, as if some people slept there and they smelled bad! After my experience with Conrad Chicago, I will please ask you to reconsider getting a room in this hotel. You get better service and accommodations even in a 1 star motel!"
"I will never stay at Conrad Chicago again. The employees were rude from the begining. When I asked for extra towels the lady at the front desk looked like I was an inconveniece. The bar staff wasn't much better. The maids never came and changed our sheet during our stay. Do not go there!"
"The Conrad Chicago is a Michelin rated hotel, so I was expecting great service and wonderful accommodations. Well, only one part of that was correct. The rooms are indeed nicely furnished, but the service was terrible! The concierge was unable to find my room reservation (I reserved online and even had the email confirmation) and wasn't very helpful in getting me a new room. I ordered room service, and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold. I mean, I understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room, but really? For the price I paid, it was definitely not worth it, and I would never use this hotel again."
"I had reservations to check into the Chicago Conrad. When we arrived my wife and I were told the hotel was oversold and that I would have to take a double room rather than a king. This was a special weekend for my wife and I so this was a big disappointment. We were offered a free dinner which we accepted. The restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good. The tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair. This took about an hour to resolve. Overall we would not pick this hotel again. They should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition. We feel it was not a good value."
"I was really excited to be visiting Chicago for the first time, and the hotel that was recommended to me was the Conrad Chicago, located on Rush Street. I wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites, and the Conrad Chicago does not disappoint in that respect. However, everything else about this hotel could be classified as sub-par, ranging from the rudeness of the check-in clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room. This hotel does not deserve to be on anyone's recommended list. My first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in. After asking for three forms of identification (most places only ask for a driver's license) and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to Chicago, she reluctantly gave me a room key. I asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if I wanted to wait, one would be able to help in about 15 minutes. I didn't feel like waiting, so I dragged my bags to the room, only to find that the room key did not work! Instead of dragging everything back down, I decided to use my cell phone to call the front desk, only there was no cell phone signal in the hall way. I couldn't believe I was in the middle of downtown Chicago and the hotel did not have a signal! I finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room, but I immediately saw there were problems. Two roaches scampered across the carpet and when I went into the bathroom, there were no towels or wash cloths. I went to turn on the TV and it didn't work. One of the lamps was missing a light bulb. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me. I was at the Conrad Chicago, not the Motel Six! I then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy. I was ready to cry. I was spending a lot of money on this hotel and it was a dump. I called down to the front desk and asked for another room, but they refused, saying I had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes. I insisted that they give me towels, fix the TV, put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches. They agreed, but told me it would take "awhile" because several of their key personnel had called in sick. My stay at the Conrad Chicago was a nightmare from beginning to end. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone"
"Imagine flying to the windy city for business. After a long flight with many delays you get a cab to your hotel, the much-hyped Conrad. You've been expecting to fall into a soft bed with a lovely view of the Chicago skyline out your window. That's exactly how I imagined it after my delayed flight and terrible cab ride. That's the opposite of how it turned out. I got in to the lobby late and the person at the counter was busy talking on their cellphone. I approached and they didn't even hang up. They were going on about how they thought the whole Charlie Sheen thing was overblown. I don't care. It's late. I have meetings the next day. I try to check in and they say they can't find my reservation. This is despite the fact I have my receipt with me! Finally, they check me in and don't even bother to have a bellhop help me with my bags. This isn't a cheap room. It's standard to treat your customers with some level of respect. I get to my room and I open the door and it's someone else's room! Somehow they've given me the wrong room and activated my key for that person's room. Worse yet, the occupant was passed out drunk on the bed with his clothes strewn all over the room. I have to carry my bags back downstairs and get checked into the right room. Finally I get up there and my room is missing a pillow. Seriously? How can the maid not notice. The bed was made. Someone must've been in the room and seen that there was one too few pillows. This episode was exemplary of the rest of my stay. Needless to say, neither I nor my business will be using the services of the Conrad in Chicago."
"My husband and I were really looking forward to spending our anniversary at the Conrad hotel. For the price we were paying we were expecting a luxurious hotel with all the amenities unfortunately it was quite the opposite. Upon arriving we were greeted by a rude and incompetent receptionist. Not only could she not find our reservation due to the fact that she kept misspelling our name, but she refused to apologize when she finally did find them and acted as if it was our fault she couldn't spell! Our room turned out to be okay except for the stain on my pillow case which ruined the experience for me. We ate at the restaurant on site and were less than impressed with the food. It was alright but nothing out of this world. We felt we could have gotten a better meal elsewhere. All in all the Conrad was a big disappointment to both of us."
"I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago. Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites, my experience was anything but pleasent. First of all, they tell you that check in time is at 3pm. Well I arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready. After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready, I decided to go settle in. The carpets in the room smelled old and musty. Additionally, the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips, scratches, and dents in the furniture. Although the bed was comfortable, I just couldn't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet. It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep. All in all, my experience was not the worst I've ever had, but far from anything worth writing home about."
"I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad Chicago Hotel, located on North Rush Street. As part of the Hilton hotel chain, I was confident that I would have a positive experience. Unfortunately, from the time I walked in the door until the time I checked out, I was plagued with nothing but problems. When I walked into the hotel, I was not greeted by the concierge, which is usually a bad sign. (He was reading a newspaper.) Then, when I announced that I was holding a reservation, they desk clerk was unable to find it. I had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system, but they could not find the room I had reserved. Finally, they assigned me a room, but it was smaller than I had originally requested and it had a bad odor. I was very disappointed with the room and its decor. The room smelled of stale smoke, even though it was on a non-smoking floor. The bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom. I had to keep checking to make sure I was really at the Conrad Chicago. Surely, this was not the way the Hilton chain operates! There continued to be problem throughout my stay. I asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late, which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting. I ordered breakfast to be brought to my room, and it never showed up -- at all! And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm, so my shower was short and unsatisfying. I decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues. Upon my return home, I wrote a letter to the hotel manager, but never received a reply. Because they refused to acknowledge that I had problems, I will not be staying at the Conrad Chicago again, and will avoid all Hilton Hotels in the future."
"I really wish I could say that I liked this hotel, but the whole experience was just plain awful. My first warning sign should have been when I made my reservation. The person I spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing. At first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel, and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel I was actually wanting, he booked me for the wrong dates. He read me the right dates, and it was only when I called back two days later to confirm that I found out he'd given me the wrong dates. Hilton did get it fixed, but I already had a bad feeling about my stay. Then came actually staying at the hotel. The people at the check-in desk were downright rude. Then there was the room. I was supposed to be in a non-smoking room, but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. The hotel staff refused to believe me, but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes. However, I might as well have stayed in the first room. I was short towels, and it took four calls(over a period of 12 hours) to the front desk to get some. The sheets had not been changed, made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. Yes, I was able to get fresh sheets, but like the towels, it took several hours for them to be delivered. Since this is a pet friendly hotel, lucky me I got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. The walls were so paper thin, all I could hear all night was barking. When I complained about it, the staff refused to believe me, and said that the walls of the room are so thick I shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door. Yeah right. I was excited to use the pool, but just like my room, it hadn't been cleaned recently. Then, I tried the fitness center. Half the equipment was broken. I tried to cut my stay short, but of course this hotel wouldn't work with me at all. They even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness I had to deal with. I will never stay with Hilton again, and I will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was."
"Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand. My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary. After looking at several hotels in the "Magnificent Mile" territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad. The Conrad's website impressed us immediately. The pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. In any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September. My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. It cost a pretty penny, more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad. Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. That ended when we found out that our "view" was of a back alley service corridor. So much for the skyline. Overall, the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. The spa had very limited hours as well. Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams, away from the hotel. It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago. I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago. I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms, but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet."
"We booked an American Girl Place package at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. Told that we'd have a room with a nice view, apparently their idea of a nice view is of another building! Ended up getting a smoking room when we booked non-smoking, cost us $100 more a night than we were told, and staff was incredibly rude at the restaurant. Would never recommend coming here for any reason whatsoever!"
"I have recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and the visit was most unpleasant. This hotel was loud and the staff was very rude. All the fancy lights and designs are just a distraction from the snobby people who stay there and the people who work there that seem to hate their jobs. The hotel food was old, it seemed like they were making it all at once for all the people staying there. The beds were hard and uncomfortable and it was an over all bad experience in what looked like a "nice place to spend a vacation""
"I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel. Me and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be. When we walked in the door there was a horrid odor. Almost like a public bathroom. The check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative. She would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet! When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting. The beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks. After the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast. The food there tastes and looks like vomit. The rest of the weeks stay there was like living in Hell. The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel is definitely not a good place to stay. It is actually probably on of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at."
"The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while. At almost $500 a night, one would expect. Traveling with my wife, I expected to pay the cost of the room, already being outrageous, but then I was hit with another $20 charge for her to stay. Even with a King bed, they only figure in one person to their cost. The beds were average and although there was much to do, everything cost an arm or a leg. It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis, if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night, I definitely would have stayed somewhere else. I guess you live and you learn, its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations."
"If you want a 5-star hotel with 1-star service, make sure you book your next Chicago stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. When I checked in to the hotel, I had to wait at the desk for over ten minutes with no line. I was greeted with no "thank you for your patience," or anything similar. The room was fine, but nothing too glamorous or outstanding. The internet cost $14.95/day which is outrageous considering the price of the hotel itself. The thing that pushed me over the edge, however, was the valet parking. When I wanted my car in the morning, I had to wait 15 minutes to be acknowledged (the valets were talking to each other and ignoring me altogether). And for this "service" I was charged $51.00/night!!!! When I went to complain at the front desk, they just said that sometimes the valets get overwhelmed, and you have to exercise patience! I will exercise patience as I check out of this hotel!!!"
"My wife and I live in the Western Suburbs of Chicago. For our anniversary, we booked a night at the Fairmont based on recommendations from friends. While the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city, the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations. For starters, we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive. However, the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us. While the room was certainly adequate, the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included. While the latter may seem like a minor offense, it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality. Finally, the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicago's standards. In summary, the Fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price, I am sure we could of done better."
"My stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was by far the worst hotel stay I ever had. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. They promised I would be able to relax in the spa area and it was dirty and not relaxing at all. When I got to my room I ordered room service and it took them 45 minutes to bring what I ordered. I am highly dissatisfied."
"For starters, I had trouble reaching the front desk. Every time I called it would ring endlessly! When finally I did reach someone, she was snooty, impolite, and altogether unhelpful. Being from the south and not knowing anything about Chicago I was hoping the staff would have been more helpful in guiding me around such a large metropolitan area. As I was there on business, I was really looking forward to the Wi-Fi access so that my business activity would go uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this was not the case. After multiple log in attempts I ended up going to a local "internet bar." As attractive as the rooms and the hotel itself were, the complete and utter lack of service and delivering up to expectations was disappointing."
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. What I expected to be a very pleasant experience, turned out to be a stressful visit. We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation. Upon arrival, the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful. As we had no other options, we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds. I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong! There wasn't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I cannot help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out. To add insult to injury, the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation, partial refund or related "perk" to make up for our great inconvenience. Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do! Although we paid for the breakfast package, we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense. Pardon the pun, but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel's lack of customer service! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but, thus far, we have received no satisfaction. Needless to say, we will not be visiting this property again! In fact, we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels."
"My family stayed at this hotel and walking into the Lobby I expected a very good experience. Once I made my way to the counter and was Greeted (Not Really) I knew this may be a bad experience. The Customer Service Person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes. Once I got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out. The High Chair that we requested still had spots of food on it. The Rest Room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper. After we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid. Luckily we only had to stay there one day. One day was almost too long."
"On a recent business trip to Chicago, I had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel. Upon entrance, the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice. However, as I approached the check in counter, the woman working there was very terse and rude to me. They had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when I asked about changing it, I was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me. After a half hour, I finally received the correct room. The linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality, they were scratchy and had a musty smell. Also, the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket (including a condom) and there was no shampoo. Also, I had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee. When I called the front desk to ask for some, they told be it was not free and would I like to charge the coffee to my account. I found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there."
"My stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Hotel was a short one; although, it was intended to be for five days, it only last two. When me and my husband arrived we were met by a valet who knicked our Mercedez. The clerk/concierge was on his phone for nearly 5 FULL minutes before he noticed that we were standing in front of him. When we checked in, we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it. We then returned to Lobby, and to our dismay, the hotel had Double Booked the room! After another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a "better" room. The bed was unbearable, the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes (although it was supposedly a non-smoking room). Too tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep. However, it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room. I needed an Ambien to go to sleep. I woke up with backaches, the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day, and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room. Me and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the Hyatt."
"Dissapointed with my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. When I looked at its web site I was convinced this was going to be the perfect place for my family and I to spend time in, when not gazing the "sites" in Chicago. Boy was I wrong, When I first arrived to check in there was no one insight at the desk. Finally, after about 20 minutes, I was approached with no apology for my wait. While trying to check in they told me there was a mixup and the room I originally requested was occupied, I was given a less spacious room, one bed for my wife and I to share with the kids, and was told they would voucher my meals that day. My wife and I love sushi so we figured we use it on that. When we were done not only was the quality of the food mediocre but they told us the voucher would not work for the sushi bar. Worst display of customer service I have ever received and will never stay there again."
"My experience with the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was Terrible! I arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour. I chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed I sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink I received was warm. When the room was finally ready I was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding. When I called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom. After all this hassle I would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered I found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13.95 for a 24 hour period. I was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels I have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access. Overall I was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel any time soon."
"On my recent weekend stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel, i was very disappointed. I chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area. From the look of the website, my expectations were above average. I felt the website led one to believe it was upscale. Upon my arrival, i checked in. I was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room. As i was settling into the room, I began to notice a general lack of cleanliness. I noticed spiderwebs in corners, and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. Also, it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room, however, it did not work and I had to call down for them to bring a replacement. I, as a guest should not have had to call down, these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in. I found the restaurants on site to be crowded, loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal. I did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items. Overall, my experience was not good and the next time I am in the area, I will chose another hotel for my stay."
"Stayed at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and it was not a good experience. The room had been cleaned in a haphazardly fashion and was not pleasant to walk into. When I called the service desk for more towels to be brought up into the room, it took an exceedingly long amount of time for them to be brought up, and the woman who delivered the towels was as rude as can be. Will not be staying at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park again."
"Whenever I decided to stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park, the only thing that I had on my mind was the idea of taking that time to relax and enjoy some time with my husband. However, the hotel choice wasn't the best. Right in the front desk when we arrived there we had problems with our reservation. The room that we had reserved was occupied and so we had to switch to some other room, which was much smaller than the original one. The hotel did give us a discount, but if I'd paid for the large room was because I wanted the it. A hotel with this name shouldn't put its guests in these kind of situation. I wont be reserving room there again."
"My experience as Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was horrible. Me and my wife were on a road trip from New York and stopped had reservations for Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel. We arrived at 12:00 AM and they did not have a non-smoking room available for which we booked! My wife was pregnant at the time and the reception staff had no sympathy. My wife couldn't handle the smell of the room so I asked for a refund to go stay somewhere else. They refused and were very rude and unhelpful. We had to stay the night, and the first thing next morning we did was leave and look for a different hotel. I will never stay at this hotel again."
"I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel, and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had. One of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special, "pure" rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic. Because I suffer from extreme allergies -- and I really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities. I'll tell you this right now -- save your money. When I got to my room, I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold. To add to the gross factor, I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet. The comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it. There was no way I was going to stay in this room, so I made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room. The woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer. After making me wait for another twenty minutes, she finally informed me that they could put me in another room, but it would be a four hour wait. Four hours! It was absolutely ridiculous. No hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way. I do not recommend the Fairmont nor will I ever stay there again."
"The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was supposed to be our romantic get away and it turned into a nightmare! When we got there our room wasn't done! We were not offered anything to do, drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the 20 minutes that they said it would be finished. The clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone! How rude! We were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done. And after waiting that long for the room, can you believe it? There was a dirty towel in the bathroom. The television didn't work, we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it. Plus, the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair. I'm so mad I'm writing the owners and letting them know! This really made me mad. We haven't taken a vacation in years and I was expecting the Fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs. Even the concierge snickered at my boots, so what, I like to wear Doc Martens! It makes me mad even thinking about the Fairmont. At least my time in Chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame."
"Hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you're traveling with luggage and/or kids. They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees. Rooms feature either double or king sized beds; no queen beds at all. If you want a little extra leg room in your bed, the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff. Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge, too."
"I was very disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins. to get off the phone. When I arrived in the room the bed wasn't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty. I called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment(on the twelveth floor). Once downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong. When I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean... There was hair all over the floor, toilet and shower. The shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror. My allergies started to bother me, immediately upon entering the room, so I checked the filter in the air conditioner. Which looked like it had never been cleaned.The comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum. While waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner. Which proved to be as bad as the rooms. The lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy. The steak was rare and I asked for medium. Not to mention, it tasted like rotten meat.The veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry. To top the whole experience off... When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay."
"On a recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millemmium Park Hotel I was appalled at the service I received at such a supposedly high end hotel. When I arrived I had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in. Apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with. Finally I was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area. Much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and I heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight. And the room was obviously a room for smokers. The blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke. I, of course complained, but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but I was welcome to check out and go to another hotel. After a fitfull night's sleep I awoke to children running up and down the hallway. Their parents were no where in sight. My shower was cold and had no pressure. I was given two towels one of which had not been laundered. I could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it. I cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark."
"The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago was the worst hotel I ever went to! I booked a non-smoking room online, and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed. After going in my room, I smelled heavy smoke smell. It was really bad. I called the front desk about the issue, and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me! There was also blood stains on my bed sheets. The carpet was also dirty. I would never book at that Hyatt again!"
"During my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, I was severely disappointed in the quality of the facility and its staff. To start off, the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms. Hoping to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings, I had hoped to spend a quiet night in. My neighbors, however, watching what I can only imagine was a Real House Wives of New Jersey marathon on full volume, destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance. When I asked the concierge to address the issue, he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job. As I visited the gym, I found their "state-of-the-art" StayFitTM gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills, weights and yoga mats. The water in the cooler was quite warm, and the workout towels were stained and tattered. Finally, all the hypo-allergenic features touted on their website were rendered null by the presence of dust balls under the beds."
"There is a great difference between a Hyatt Regency Hotel, and a normal hotel. The thing that I did not like about this hotel was the smoke section of the non smoking section was really close to each other. I get really uncomfortable when I am in a crowded area, and people are smoking their lungs out. Even though this hotel is really glamourous, has a nice bar, a nice restaurant, great music, it is still not a good stay if you don't like people smoking beside you."
"The room was very pretty, and the location is great, but the hotel is so big and they don't have the staff to take care of everything. The heating in our room was loud, making it difficult to sleep. The gym is not big enough, and the hotel parking garage is very expensive. The hotel has so many guests that the lobby was too loud to relax in. We didn't get great service at the hotel bar, and the bar ran out of bar snacks because so many people were in the bar area. Later we asked for directions to the restaurant we had dinner reservations at, and the hotel staff we asked did not know how we could get there. The next morning, the cleaning staff tried to get in while we were still in the room."
"My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I'll never ever forget - not in a good way. Check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. I went up to my room and looked around, all seemed ok at first. I was bushed so I flopped on the bed... ohhhhh noooooo! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days. But I was so tired that I just passed out. Of course I woke up with a back ache...great. I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub, turned the hot water on full force, and poured in some shower gel. I put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm. I called the front desk but they were no help, the clerk just apologized. Frustrated at this point, I turned on the tv and switched on the air. I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent. It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something. I couldn't take anymore of this. I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. It seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized, no empathy as if he's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. He offered me a free night but there is no way that I'd stay at this place again - ever."
"when i first checked the hotel's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there. but i was totally disappointed once i got there, first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one, it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that. then when i was trying to enjoy the view, they windows were all dusty and dirty. so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww!, its all i can say about this hotel."
"A friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday. The hotel at first glance was very nice and charming. But, We quickly found out that was not the case. Our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in. The bathroom was filthy, it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks!! There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror. There were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room. We immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly, unkempt room. The women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling "was not smoke" because that is not permitted in the hotel. We were also told that room was cleaned that day. After several minutes of arguing with her and a manager, we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time. WE had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us. The food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced. Our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there. All the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests. I will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one."
"Hyatt Regency Chicago seemed like a nice place to stay, but we didn't like it very much. The renovations were cheap and poorly done (our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it.) The staff was RUDE! I was trying to find a good cab service, and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call! Couldn't he have at least called someone else to help me? The "Babies Travel Lite" gave us the wrong sized diapers, so we had to go find some anyway, and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way."
"Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago. I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business, and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town, but alas, I was left disappointed. I arrived in the afternoon, my flight having been delayed, ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. Unfortunately, my room was not ready. It should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. In any event, I was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named BIG Bar. They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water, not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--I wanted only to relax in my room. I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. Was my room ready yet? 'What room?' they replied. To my astonishment, it seemed that I no longer had a reservation! How this came to pass, I do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake "Guest Not Found" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. I requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. Finally, I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel, with fewer regrets than I would have imagined, to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. As it was, I found another hotel, better priced, better staffed, and with rooms ready for my custom. So if you are looking an experience like no other, book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. If you want a place to sleep, look elsewhere."
"When I went to The James hotel in Chicago I truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising. Gorgeous chairs, staff at the desk focusing on their job, and a clean, well decorated hotel room. Much to my, and my wallet's dismay I found quite the opposite. I arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed, and found the clerk reading a magazine. It must have been a fascinating article, as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if I had a reservation, or would be making one. I said I had one, and gave him the voucher I'd printed out. He checked it, and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out, he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night. I grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and I desperately needed to get some sleep. The clerk offered to walk me to my room, saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep. I accepted, and followed him to my new room. He carried the briefcase I had with me, but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free. He ushered me into my room, setting the briefcase down inside, and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. I thanked him and closed the door. It was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying. What was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6" apart, covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. The cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. A quick look around the other areas and I found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap, not even the complementary ones were left behind. I got ready for bed, and looked around for the TV remote, which it turned out, had no batteries in it. Instead, I just turned out the lights and rolled over, sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option. In the morning I walked down to the lobby and asked to check out. I'd had enough of the hotel after one night. The clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill. $240 for my room, and an extra $80 with a note about a baggage service. I asked her about it, and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. I asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up, and riding the elevator, and she said it was unusual, but not unheard of. She offered to change it to a "mere" $20 and handed me a slip with a phone number, name, and reason for the disagreement, saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it. I did so, and left, my wallet $260 lighter, and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep."
"The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby. In other words, come here for the looks, not the amenities. They make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process.... you know, because a simple washing machine just isn't good enough. To me, this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being "rich"--which most of them are not. Meanwhile, the hotel doesn't even offer free wireless--an essential feature for business travelers like me. Obviously I'm not the intended consumer, though, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
"I have recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel and although I have stayed there a variety of times before, for both business and pleasure, my experience this time was particularly poor. From right when I checked in to the day I left I felt like I was constantly around unfriendly people who didn't want to be at work their to do their jobs. My room was dirty the whole time even though the maid came every day, and when I was trying to sleep at night it was so loud in the hallways, I couldn't sleep. For my next visit to Chicago I won't be staying at the Hyatt Regency."
"My wife and I went to Chicago to enjoy our weekend and stayed at Hyatt Regency. 'Hyatt Regency Chicago' has ruined our family holiday weekend. First of all, if you are not a diamond or platinum member, you need to reserve the room atleast 10-15 days in advance. You have to pay extra $20 for the welcome credit option. They will give you a credit of $75 for the 2 days. We only used $20 and the rest was forefeited. I talked to the manager and he said we can't use it on our next visit. The management of the hotel is full of cheap minded people. When you know most of the hotels let you use their wi-fi for free, Hyatt Regency management asked us to pay for using their wi-fi. Beware of this place, if you want to enjoy your weekend in Chicago, Hyatt Regency should be the last place you should consider staying. Thanks Sam."
"Hyatt Regency Hotel: Good ole Downtown, Chicago. Hypo-allergenic rooms are usually intended for the well-being of even the worst cases of allergen sufferers. Well, when we got to our room, one of the first things my wife did was sneeze four times. Upon setting up the channel scanning which, the reception came in fuzzy all around, there was an interattive ethernet feature that after, lost in confusion of how to work it, provided us with our first fee! The pool was in bad shape. The maids seemed to come and go with no intercommunicative qualities.. just knock knock knock. We let em' right in as they started vacuuming. One of the fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling was dimmer than the others and the Gideon's Bible had crib notes. What a room! Not to mention what the hotel was like! Oh geez."
"Whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. Most notably is cleanliness, as although the lobby was very clean, the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. Dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways, and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. The furnishings were nice and modern, but with various blemishes upon close inspection. Bathroom was relatively clean, with the exception of the shower. View was nice for this particular room, and service was relatively quick. The food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. This time with the glasses which were stained, the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. I will not make the mistake of staying here again."
"My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and will most defiantly not go back. The customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either. When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key. When we got into the room the bed was not even properly made. The cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food. We ended up going home two days before we planned."
"This hotel was full of drunks. The lobby was full of crowds at night and the bar was way too busy. There were people stumbling all over the hotel at all hours of the night, yelling in the hallways, making lots of noise. The staff had little to say. I wasn't aware of the noise level when I booked the room and when I threatened to make other reservations, the people in the lobby had nothing to say. We asked for a water view and got a city view. Again, the people at the front desk weren't accomodating at all. Overall, we had a horrible experience."
"We decided to spend a little extra to stay at this hotel while visiting our son in Chicago. Won't make that mistake again. The rooms are smaller than they appear on the web (creative photography) and the place is dirty.We've stayed at Best Westerns that are cleaner! The air conditioner is super loud ... and the walls are paper thin. The people in the next room must have been having a party and despite three calls to the front desk between 1 and 3 a.m., Security failed to stop the ruckus. Also thought the front desk staff was rude. Usually in Hyatts, Hiltons, etc., the staff is polite and tries to be accommodating. These people weren't particularly personable ... we seemed to be an interruption of their work rather than the reason for it. The only positive about the hotel was the location -- but that doesn't make up for the negative experience. Save some money and stay somewhere else!"
"I expected a bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I stayed at recently. I was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in. The linens were not clean, the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left, and there was a lock on the door that didn't function. The turndown service left me no chocolate on my pillow and I think they took a few more pieces of the already nearly empty toilet paper, again with out leaving a spare. I would not stay there again. Traveler beware!!"
"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago, IL, and boy was I surprised. The hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious. In fact, the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating. As if this were not enough, the bathroom of my room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the "fresh" towels. Towards the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls."
"I recently stayed in The James Hotel in Chicago and trust me I will never do it again. When you pay a premium price you'd expect first rate service. Our whole experience was a disaster though short lived b/c we could stay their another second. When we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready. So we had to wait in the lobby with our baggage. When we finally got to the room I wouldn't exactly call it clean but it wasn't to bad. The pictures on the website are nice enough but the furniture is falling apart and probably from Walmart. There was plenty of space for an average person of 5' but I'm 6'4" and the beds where smaller than what they said, not to mention uncomfortable. We ordered room service and not only did they bring us the wrong order but it took 2 hours. There walls were also paper thin so we got little sleep. The heater helped block out some noise until it stopped working in the middle of the night. So the next morning, sore from the uncomfortable bed, hungry tired and cold we checked out before we even had our coffee. Stay away!"
"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel, in downtown Chicago. During my three days there I experienced the worst service of my life! We made reservations before-hand and upon arrival our room was already booked. It took us nearly two hours to actually get into our room (After being given the wrong key!). When we entered the room, the sheets were stained with what seemed to be cherry kool-aid. I am going to assume that it wasn't. After a night on the town we were bummed for money by three homeless men outside the hotel. After arriving in our room and hoping for a nice hot shower, we found a note on our door with a "sorry" note explaining they didn't have any hot water. Early the next morning we were awoken by housekeeping (we had a DND sign on our door). So we decided to wake up and go out for breakfast. Comes to find out our car was broken into in their parking garage. We filed a police report and the police asked the managers for a video of the surveillance. Unfortunately for us their surveillance was out of memory to record anymore. Needless to say we left early the next day and I will never return to such a dreadful hotel ever again."
"I was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation, but unfortunately that was not to be had. From the moment we arrived at the Omni, the staff was belligerent and extremely rude. They had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before. If we weren't so tired, we would've gone to a different hotel right then, but hindsight is 20/20. After we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby, we decided to go down to the pool, which was tiny and kind of dirty, so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing. The internet access was really slow. I will NEVER stay here again. Save yourself the headache and book somewhere else!"
"During my latest business trip, both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago,Illinois, at one of their Deluxe suites. Unfortunately, and I think I speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. The hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. When one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. First of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. Second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. For people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem. Especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. For these, as well as other similar reasons, I would not recommend this hotel, if one is looking for luxury accommodations."
"Did not enjoy my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. Firstly, the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful. There was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle. Secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out, the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees. Considering I paid well over $250 per night for the Romance package reservation, it was below my standards and I will not be heading back to the Omni Chicago Hotel any time soon."
"I had never been to Chicago and was looking forward to sightseeing after my business conference. My company had arranged for me to stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel located in the center of the Magnificent Mile. Once I arrived at the hotel and gave it the once over, I was pleased but not impressed. Once I put down by luggage and inquired about my reservation. I was told that my room was not ready yet and that there'd be an hour delay. I tried not to lose my temper and pleasantly asked if I could have another room. I was told there was a convention going on in the hotel and every room was filled. I would have left, but my company had a account at this hotel. If I stayed somewhere else, I'd have to pay out of pocket. The service employee behind the counter flippantly told me to take a seat and went back to talking with his gum-chewing co-worker. I picked up my luggage and plopped down in a cushy chair that wobbled. The leg in front on the left side was broken. I picked up my luggage and moved to another chair. Two hours passed by before I was given my room. When I walked into the room the first thing I smelled was cigarette smoke. I was mad because I explicitly asked for a "non-smoking" room. I was furious. I didn't feel like going back downstairs and dealing with the idiot behind the counter and I was tried from my long flight. I sighed, tipped the bellboy and slammed the door to my room. I thought maybe I could use the air conditioning to freshen the room. When I went to turn it on, it didn't work. Tired and angry, I went to sleep, thinking I'll never stay at this hotel again."
"The Omni Chicago Hotel was in one word, dreadful. The hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic. The service is terrible. If you want to wait for your room for 3 and a half hours this is the place to go! Throughout a whole week, beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned. The hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit, they give no info for any activities going on in Chicago. This hotel should be listed in the top 10 WORST hotels in America. Do not waste your time nor money staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel."
"After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel, I can honestly say that I will take the time to book a room, ahead of time, on my next visit to Chicago. We were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was, at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place. The outside of the hotel was pristine, but our room was filthy! We requested a non-smoking room, but it had obviously been smoked in before, as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air. In fact, we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking, but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well. To top it off, room service brought us the wrong item. When we checked out, we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item, even after we sent it back. I would also have to point out that Michigan Avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class. Right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes. I couldn't even go to the gas station after 8 p.m. because I was too scared to leave the hotel. The pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding, thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to. For the price of the room I would say this place was a definite disappointment. I have learned my lesson to check out the room before I agree to stay in it next time. This place gets 1/2 of a star from me."
"After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently, I was nothing but disappointed. This "luxury hotel" obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable. When I arrived, my hotel room was devoid of towels, and after calling down to the front desk, it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered. On top of that, when I went to connect to the internet in my room, the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop! For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their "superior corner suite", I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn, and after this stay, I wish I had."
"First off, don't get a room on a lower floor, the garbage pick up makes a ton of noise and wakes you up at 6 am. Then don't bother going down for breakfast at that time either, because the restaurant isn't open that early. When it finally opened, the breakfast arrived cold and late. Nothing like congealed eggs to start your day. The fitness center had no towels and no cups for water. It was also too hot and too many people had sweated too much in it. After my congealed breakfast, it really was not pleasant. My entire three day visit was like that. I tried room service that night, but again, service was very slow and the food not warm when it arrived. My high speed internet was not so high speed when it would connect me at all. The furniture was run down and worn. Pool towels were not always available. Generally, for the price I paid, I would expect better service and a better maintained premises."
"I had such a horrible experience when I stayed at Omni Chicago Hotel last Saturday night. First of all, the plasma TV in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available, and they weren't particularly apologetic about it, either. Secondly, it was supposedly a non-smoking hotel, but as an ex-smoker, I can tell that people had smoked in the room recently. Additionally, the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels, which was really disappointing, because I was looking forward to using the pool. Finally, check-out was supposed to be at noon. At 11:15 am, the maid was knocking at the door. She asked if I would be out soon, and I thought was very quite intrusive. I will never, ever stay at that place again."
"I was disappointed in my stay at The James. I am on a strict gluten free diet and was told the hotel restaurant could accomodate my needs. Each time I sat down for a meal, I would explain my dietary needs to the waiter. Most times, I ended up having to send the plate back because some gluten item was included. My wife has sleep apnea and when we made our reservations, I made sure to ask if there was a room available with an outlet near the bed so that she could plug in her CPAP machine. I was assured that this was no problem. However, when we arrived at the hotel, we had to request a room change because there was no outlet near the bed. We had to wait in the lobby for sometime because the room we were moved to was not yet finished benig cleaned. Overall, it was not an entirely horrific stay, but I expected more out of a hotel of this supposed caliber. Next time I visit Chicago, I will be staying at another hotel."
"Last week, I booked a 'Deluxe Suite' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago. I took the 'Retreat and Relax' package deal. The wait to check in was intolerably long, because they were letting some people check in with a dog. I'm allergic to dogs, and I'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in. They insisted on escorting me to to my room, every time I came in, like I was going to break into another guest's room or something. I swear, anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks, asking me if I needed anything. You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you're up to something. I went to the pool, but it was full of screaming children. When I went to bed, I could hear the television in the next room through my wall. And what's worse, they wouldn't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. They threatened to throw me out on the street, after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars! I had to go outside-- probably where the dog went to piddle-- to do it. Also, their on-site restaurant is too expensive, given that you're already paying an arm and a leg for the room. The food should be free! I wouldn't stay here again, it was a waste of my money."
"When my boyfriend and I checked into our room at the Omni Chicago, we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled, as if kids had been jumping on it. That was just the first of our "issues". The glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them, and I saw a (dead-thank goodness!) roach behind the toilet. We were given the hotel night stay by a friend, so we decided to just deal with it. We ordered some munchies from the kitchen, and the chips were stale, and the dip smelled sour. After coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies, we were able to enjoy our stay--but I would not recommend this place to anyone!"
"Recently staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel, was a waste of money. The rooms are typical standard rooms,(unless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms), the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless, your ideal, idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room. Sorry to say in short I think my money would have been better spent staying at a HoJo's."
"I recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel and it was awful. When I arrived my room was not ready. Two hours later when it was finally cleaned, I entered and saw they they had not brought the cot that I had requested for my son. I asked for it again, but they never brought it. My mattress was uncomfortable, and I did not like sharing it with my son. The AC did not even work and it was terribly hot in the room. The next morning we ate the continental breakfast before leaving, and it too was bad. There was cereal, low quality yogurt, and burnt flavorless muffins. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
"I have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel. The Omni Chicago's age shows, and not in a "great ambiance" way! The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking. I say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor, almost like mildew, that permeated the first room we were given. Seriously, it brought tears to my eyes! The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma, but finally agreed to switch us to another room. The new one didn't smell, but was clearly past its prime. Housekeeping was almost nonexistent. We had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels. How can you forget to leave towels for the guests? I'm not one to complain, but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here, we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment. We received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago."
"The Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it. First of all, it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare. If you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you. When I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in, and I thought the wait time was ridiculous. To make matters worse, I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room. Two hours later they managed it get to work, the connection was still very slow. For my part, the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations. I was disappointed and will never stay there again, if I go back to Chicago. If was rating it, I would give it 1/2 star out of 5."
"Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. At first once coming into the room, there was a mildewy smell in the air, which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. To make matters even worse, the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon, when my wife was back from exploring the city. This was simply unacceptable by any standard."
"Don't stay here! My family and I stayed here for a weekend trip. The staff were rude and acted like we were bothering them. The rooms looked nice in photographs but when we got there our room looked like it hadn't been dusted in ages. Overall bad service and not worth the money."
"I will never stay here again. I was lured in by the hotel's pictures showing a fabulous suite. Instead I arrived to find cheap furniture that smelled of old cheese. I called the front desk to see if there was another room available. I was put on hold for five minutes and no one came back on the line. I ended up going to the front desk myself. I was ignored and not given assistance until I interrupted the front desk clerk who seemed to be on a personal call. The clerk apologize but then looked at me with an attitude when I requested another room because mine smelled like old cheese. I was informed that there were no other rooms available but that they would send up housekeeping. Housekeeping sprayed some Febreeze on the couch and then left. I tried to relax by turning on the TV in the bedroom. I sat on the bed and saw something scurry under the pillow. I checked the corner of the mattress and found bedbugs. I packed up my bags and left after that. I did get a refund on the room after some complaining. I went across town to the Marriott where I had a much better stay."
"I would never stay here again. For a hotel that calls itself a four-diamond hotel, it cannot even provide the most basic amenities and services. I would have been more comfortable staying in a run-down motel. The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained."
"I was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business, but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago. When I arrived, my reservation could not be found in their system, although I had made it myself. After some words with the manager on duty, Mr. Chad Montgomery, I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate. Anyone can make a mistake, so I wasn't too angry at that point. My room was bland and colorless, in spite of The James' boasts of their attention to design and detail. The room was mostly clean, but after seeing the stains on the bedding, I am not convinced that they were washed after the room's last occupant. I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night, complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy, disgruntled waitstaff. Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. I was assured that I would enjoy "Asha's Purifying Shower Ritual", which would primarily take place in my own room. The shower was okay, but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided, because I broke out in hives all over my body. Next came the "in-room" portion. While I was in the shower, five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. I guess they were supposed to make it smell good, but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room. My masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion, but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking. I am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu. In closing, if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago, I beg of you to reconsider. With only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel, and a suitcase full of negative (including a pending court case against the masseuse), I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there. I know I do."
"I was extremely disappointed with my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. It was a hot summer day and I turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out. I called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it. I felt the person I spoke to was rude to me. They were not accepting responsibility, but talking down to me as if I was stupid. After waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower. This was not a service person. He could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem I was having. He expected a tip and complained when I did not give him one. Nobody came up after that. I was told I could switch to a different room, so I had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor. The shower did work in this other room, but I didn't have the view of the city that I had in the first room. I was looking at a brick wall. Plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night. I complained and the hotel staff told me they were VIPs and could not do anything about the noise. This hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable. Do not go to the Omni Hotel. I've stayed in $50 a night motels with better service."
"My stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live. I was there for a week long conference. Although my reservations had been made months in advance, they did not have a suite for me when I arrived, resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night. Once my room was ready, I was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen: barely large enough to move around, and very few utensils to cook with. The pool was only open for limited hours, and I should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit. At night I was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside. My overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite. I will not book here ever again."
"My husband and I were sorely disappointed in this hotel. We had requested a non smoking room, and right off we were hit with the stinch of stale cigarettes when we opened the door. The front desk was not responsive to our needs at all, but we did finally get moved to a new room. The water pressure in the shower was hardly enough to get the shampoo out of our hair and the beds were lumpy. I was very disappointed in the workout room, it was very small so I decided to swim laps instead, but when I got to the pool it didn't look like it had been maintained all week. Needless to say we won't make the mistake of staying with Homewood Suites again."
"Atrocious. Here's our story: My wife and I are Californians but met as students at the University of Chicago. To celebrate our 10th anniversary, we decided to travel back to the Windy City and revisit all of the places we frequented when we were first falling in love. When it came to lodging, we knew we wanted a suite but little else mattered. We wanted to revisit the city and didn't intend to spend very much time in our room. As a result, we didn't spend very much time researching hotels. Big mistake. Our stay at Homewood Suites could not have been worse. Our room, which, I should mention, took a full two hours for them to prepare even though we had booked it months in advance, was filthy. (My wife found a dead cockroach in the bathroom.) The staff was rude and indifferent. The chocolates included in the Romance Package could not have cost the hotel more than a dollar. Cleaning staff failed to show up. Front desk offered apologies but little else. Suffice it to say, we checked out early. Never before have I seen such a poorly-managed hotel. Truly shameful. Stay away!"
"I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week, and I was extremely disappointed with my experience. The breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked. I came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted. Also, the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm, having been kept out on the counter. I would have been better off bringing my own food! Also, the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward. I had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV, and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways. I could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed. It just wasn't what I would expect from a Hilton-brand hotel suite."
"I stayed with my husband at the Homewood Suites in Chicago. We wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the Hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay. Unfortunately this was not the case! The staff was very rude at check-in (which took 20 minutes) and the lobby smelled musky and gross. The room itself was not like other Hilton hotels I have stayed at. The carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit, the room smelled of smoke (even though it's advertised as smoke-free) and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed! I was so grossed out that I had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it. And don't even get me started on how poorly the shower/bathtub worked..a nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is. If I could give it 0 stars, I would!"
"DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton, especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed. Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her! When I finally got into my room I was appalled. I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet. I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room, which I was advised that I was. I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one. One I entered my new room, I found that once again it stank of smoke, but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning. BAD IDEA! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs. I packed my stuff and checked out that night, however a refund was refused. I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!"
"I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton's famous hotels. I gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to. In fact, Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet. I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape. In fact, the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early. I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel. I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room, they ignored me. How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo didn't look like the actual logo. It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw. I'll never go to this hotel again and it won't even be in a million years for that matter. This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer."
"I really had high hopes for Homewood Suites when I stayed there on a week-long business trip last month. After all, considering their prices (it's technically a Hilton), you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel. I'll start with the good stuff about the hotel: it's in downtown. Now for the bad stuff: first, everyone is rude. I'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. The bellboy scowled at me in the lobby, was rough with my luggage, and then scowled at me again when I tipped him $5. Likewise, the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. She had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in, and I had a reservation! Apparently she was new, and didn't have much experience using the computer, but that's no excuse: it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. Sadly, the room was no better than the service. The hot water in the sink did not work, the shower was only lukewarm, and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. Complimentary mood lighting, I guess. The TV was a bust; sure it was an LCD, but the ESPN logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. And to top it all off, the bed smelled funny. I called the front desk (at least the phone worked), and asked for fresh sheets. The person I talked to said they'd be right up, but never came. Eventually, I gave up. I woke up the next morning to back pain (the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow). I left the room, and made my way through the chilly hallways to the "complimentary buffet." Literally all the food was bad. Even the cereal tasted stale. Looking around, everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience. The sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel. Just plain sad. Worst part was, it was the same thing for the next four days, too."
"Whatever you do, do NOT stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. I made that mistake, and it was terrible! The bed linens were obviously not clean - there was even a stain on the comforter - and the housekeeping staff there absolutely did not care about doing a good job. Our room was only "cleaned" twice in a week's stay, and even then only the barest minimum of effort seemed to go into it. They didn't even empty the trash cans! As for the "in-suite" kitchen, it was awful. We were hoping to save money by cooking in our room, but with one broken eye on the stove and a nasty, greasy microwave? It seemed a better idea to eat out, and avoid any more unpleasant surprises from their lackluster in-house food. I didn't hear good things about their breakfast offerings, anyways. If I were you, I'd avoid this place like the plague. I know I'm certainly never going back!"
"James Chicago would be one of the worst hotels I have ever been to in my life! Even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic, its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible. They gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago! I figured it was because the hotel was busy but I started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service. The television was not working at all. I was extremely disapointed, especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax. Sadly, i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment. The Wifi was a bust. Absolutely nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall. I am never going to James Hotel ever again!"
"Our vacation was highlighted by a four day stay at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown.I believed it would be the best part of the trip; I discovered it was an unfolding nightmare. While in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor, a voice emanating from the phone, informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow. Anyone above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom, wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed door.Do not use the elevators and wait for further instructions.We nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phone.We then decided to exit via the stairs, realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells, doors behind you were locked.We continued to travel downward, against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers.Obviously, we were rescued without any physical injuries; yet emotionally we were damaged.I now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less."
"This place was absolutely foul. From the minute I walked in, I knew making a reservation here was a mistake. The person at the counter would barely make eye contact with me and acted like I was asking a huge favor of them in order to check in. The room we requested (a room with double beds) was not available. They told me that when I made the reservation, requesting double beds was a "request" and not a "guarantee." What's the point of making a reservation, then? When we got to the room, the room was totally gross. The decor was dated, the carpet was torn in spots and the whole place smelled musty and almost moldy. The bathroom had spots and stains all over it. I hesitate to think of the true cleanliness of the sheets. The "complimentary" fitness area was a joke. One broken treadmill and a couple of mismatched dumbbells. Thanks but no thanks. We will definitely not return."
"My husband and I planned a romantic getway for past several months and was looking forward to spending the end of the summer in Chicago. However our excitement soon turned to disappointment and frustrations upon our arrival. The hotel was quite charming when we walked in the door but then everything went wrong. The gentleman checking us in could not find our reservation and was quite impatient and rude once we showed our confirmation papers. The manager did make accomondations for us after much discussion back and forth. We did not have towels in the room when we checked in and it took at least an hour and several phone calls before the towels were sent to our room. Needless to say, I was extremely tired and wanted nothing more than to take a warm shower and turn in. If we had not paid the total cost up front, we would have just left and check into another hotel."
"I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown, and found it lacking in the quality of their service. The rooms are nice and well furnished, but the service lacks in some areas. Some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access, cardio-fitness and indoor pool, grocery shopping service and coffee, tea, hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby's 24 hour convenience shop. However the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times, the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned. The grocery shopping service was alright, although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality. Rating this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5, I would give it a 3 at best."
"I don't know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others. This hotel was for me: over priced, fingerprints on the walls, stains in the bathroom, funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning, parking/valet was time consuming, and same thing with the elevator. The back to the 1960's furniture is not for me, and what about the breakfast? Better to skip their protein-less stuff they had to offer. Oh sure it is a Hilton, woopee! You pay for the privilege of sleeping there. Saw a couple of bed bugs, but took a shower in the morning, and they seemed to wash away. I won't be back to Hilton Homewood Suites again. I'd rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money. Think that I'll be happier as well."
"Oh my goodness, this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown Chicago. It all went well enough checking in, but them went downhill. There was so much left to be desired. The biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet, I kid you not! I guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it, I just don't know. But for the prices they charge, this type of thing is unacceptable. Most everything else about the actual room was as expected. The noise was a bit more than I'm used to though, but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us. So we asked to be moved to another room, they did get us in another room, but that took nearly 2 hours. The second room worked out well for us, but I won't be risking staying here again. Plus the pool was not available, I really wish they would have mentioned that on their website, I was looking forward to it for days. All in all, it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location, but they need to work on their customer service before I'll reconsider staying at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown."
"I was in business in Chicago, so I decided to choose what I thought would be a relaxing hotel to treat myself a bit. I should have known when the woman at the front desk rolled her eyes when I asked for some of the complimentary apple cider advertised. She told me, "It's by the signs" in a "you-idiot" kind of voice. Too bad the signs were too far away from me to read without my glasses! I was ashamed and did not ask for anything from the front desk again. The room itself was horribly decorated and nothing special. The "I'm too ugly to steal" furniture patterns and colors did not say "luxury" to me! I went down to relax by the pool with my laptop, to get some work done. Unfortunately, the pool was overrun with about five rowdy kids. No parents in sight. I would have reported them to the front desk, but was shamed by the aforementioned apple cider incident. Thank God I left my laptop in its case, or it would have been ruined by all of the water that was splashed on me! The "free breakfast" tasted like cardboard; it was something akin to a free breakfast at a $60-a-night hotel. I only tried it once because it made me feel sick when I ate it. The only good thing about my experience was leaving this overpriced motel behind to go to work!"
"Not worth the price! I had the unfortunate experience of staying in the Hilton Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago. I stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. I wish I would have saved my money and went somewhere else. With a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. Not a chance. In addition to the $259 price tag, I also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. If I had stayed at the Motel 6, parking would have been free. The staff there were not very nice at all. When I registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. She was very rude to me. Perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but I doubt it. After I arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and I had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). The rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. I didn't go on vacation to cook though. The television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). I tried logging into Facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the "complimentary" internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. I get a better connection at Starbucks. They offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. I've had better food at McDonald's. The food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. Traffic around the hotel was hideous. This hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. There are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. The room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. If you're looking for a hotel in Chicago, I'd say save some money and go somewhere else. I've had better stays at the Best Western and many other hotels that cost less."
"Homewood Suites is a Hilton Group Hotel located in downtown Chicago. Though close to many sights, when we visited there was extensive construction going on along Michigan Avenue, so every morning we were awakened right at 8 am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers. We reserved the basic suite. Though we arrived at 5 pm, well past check-in time, our room was not ready for 30 minutes. The management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience. Once the suite was ready, it was nice. But then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom. We were relocated to another room with apologies, but again, no offer of compensation for the trouble. Once we were finally settled, the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer. The food was okay, but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point. The staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service. We though it was a good idea since we were already so tired. Unfortunately, it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected. All in all we were disappointed with our experience at Homewood suites. We understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable. I would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting Chicago."
"After considering several hotels in the area, my family and I finally decided, unfortunately, on Homewood Suites, for our long weekend vacation. Overall, the experience left much to be desired. The breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries. The linens on one of our beds seemed dirty, and when I told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced, the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude. I would not come back here ever."
"James Chicago; the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised. I didn't want stay in this hotel, but my wife insisted. Ok, so when I booked the ticket, it cost me $299 for one room. $299! I could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point! The room was stylish though, it looked nice. There was a TV, and the beds were fine. Although I couldn't quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer. Why would I even need wifi if there is no computer? What were they thinking!? The experience I had with James Chicago was a bit below of what I had expected. I mean the food available there wasn't very tasty at all. I had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet, but they had no computer, only wifi. That's like only having bread, without any fillings to make it into a sandwich!"
"I stayed three nights recently at the Hilton Homewood Suites- Downtown Chicago. Overall I can't rate this establishment highly. The person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation. Once I finally got my key, the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me. It didn't get any better when I got to my suite. The bed was poorly made, and I found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows. The room was very stuffy, and I swear might have even had a vague pet smell. My shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door,and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip. Also, the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. I also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also. It had limited equipment that was in poor repair. The floor in there was even slippery, which made it a definite trip hazard. While the indoor pool looked good, as I dipped into it, the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell. All in all, the amenities, the unfriendly service, and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one I would definitely not recommend to anyone. When that is paired with their sky high room rates, it's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests."
"I stayed at the Knickerbocker Hotel the last time I visited Chicago. I lived in Illinois during college, and as I was on a college budget, most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown. For my visit back, I decided I would treat myself to a nicer stay than I was used to, so I booked a room at the Knickerbocker. Everything looked nice when I got there, but for the price I paid, I was really expecting something far above and beyond what I got. Maybe I wasn't dressed right, or didn't carry the right luggage, but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when I checked in. Shouldn't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome? When I stayed at the cheap hotels in college, the front desk employees were always friendly when I checked in and out, and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. Here, I didn't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because I didn't want to deal with the eye rolling and "too important to be bothered" attitude I got when I checked in. I guess the location was more convenient than the hotels I used to visit, but I really thought that part of the money I was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. Look, obviously I can afford to stay at your hotel, I already booked and paid for the room. Even if customer service isn't your number one goal, making money should be pretty high up on the list, and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isn't a very good way to secure return business. I doubt I'll stay here again."
"After a my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it. While the amenities were plush, the service of the staff was lacking. Upon check in, my reservation was "lost" and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay. There was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way. Room service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room. A used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out. I am not sure my sheets were changed out. When I checked out, the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report I spent days creating. Overall my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers. I will be relunctant to stay with them again until I am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better."
"Not one of my better experiences, When I first arrived at the hotel and tried to get my room key it was discovered that they were fresh out of keys. I had to wait half an hour while someone ran out to get more keys. It wouldn't have been as bad but the lobby looked to be in slight disrepair. When I finally got to the room I found the burnt out light bulb and an unmade bed. The room was an ok size for one person but any more than that and it would probably get a bit crowded. But the view from the window was amazing, and it took away some of the bad for me. Overall, it just felt like the owners of the hotel stopped caring, maintenance took four or so hours to finally come fix the light. I didn't even get housekeeping my entire stay there. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone in the area, hopefully it will make them get their act together."
"Do NOT stay at this hotel! A friend and I booked a 3-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in Chicago. Though it was a bit pricy, we decided on the Knickerbocker because it was in a great location, and the rooms looked large and well-kept. Our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time. However, despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay, when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an HOUR until we were allowed up to our room. The concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us, and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late. To top it off, the maid service was terrible. The only thing they seemed to do was make the bed; no vacuuming, no fresh towels, etc. We didn't want to stay the third night, but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee. This hotel is way too much money for the services they provide, you'd be better off staying in a Motel 6."
"I went to stay in the Millenium Hotel Chicago. Now, first, being from rural midwest I was surprised at the price in general, but kind of accepted it when I was assured by my cousin(whom I was visiting in Chicago) said it was normal. So I check in, service seems fine. I get checked in, room seems ok. A couple of hours later, a lady comes into my room, not a hotel employee, just some lady. Turns out, they cross checked the rooms. We(her and I) went down and complained. Turns out they double booked the room, not that they were full, but they were full on THAT room type, Standard, as well as the Superior Rooms. Rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to "move up". We argued with them for 20 minutes, they didn't budge, our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $60 for a Corner Superior. We(the lady, her name was Sharon) decided to split the difference some, she gave me $20 and I moved. I get to the new room about 20 minutes later, nobody, but Sharon helped me move. I get there, the bed was thrown together, not made, and the bathroom wasn't clean, the garbage had a kleenex in it(I wasn't going to check if it was used). I called down, it was now 5PM. No answer, I called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone. I told them about the state of my room. They said they would have someone up "right away". I waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in, not in uniform, but she did a hell of a job cleaning. She switched out the garbage, wiped out the whole bathroom, vaccuumed around me, and switched out the bedding, all told she was in and out in 10 minutes. She didn't say two words to me, but she did clean. I stayed the night and checked out a 7AM and will never go back. Ryan from Iowa"
"When I walked into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel, my first thought was ,"wow this is very yellow", and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day, no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse. my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in. It was a Victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms. i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms."
"The Millennium Hotel Knickerbocker sounds fine, and the website is pretty, but the reality is an over-hyped, overpriced, reality-isn't-as-good-as-fantasy package. The catering they offer is a joke; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the Chicago area. While the rooms were cleaner than most, there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses, and when I called to complain about it, a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off. The rooms look small but cozy when you book online, but when you get there in person, you realize just how tiny they are. Trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did I mention that it smelled like cleaning solution? I also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed, which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is. In fact, it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small; you'd get better prices and a far better room from the Hilton."
"I chose to stay at the 'Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel' during a recent trip to Chicago because I had heard they had good reviews. Boy, were these reviews wrong!! I had terrible service from the moment I walked in the doors. I was not greeted by the receptionist, it was like I wasn't even there. My room was NOT ready for me when I got there, even though I got there AFTER my required check-in time, then once I was allowed to go to my room, it was filthy! It was as if they didn't even clean it, so I don't know what the hold up was. There were no towels, shampoo or soap in the bathroom. The worst part was that there were bugs in the tub! The place was the most disgusting place I've ever been to, and it is supposed to be one of the nicest! It should be the nicest for the price they charge. I do not recommend staying here! Stay at your own risk!!"
"I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago. Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 (one!!) front desk agent 30 minutes to process. Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding, it seemed, wrong room types and being out of the room type requested. I was nervous about my own reservation and, sure enough, my Superior Corner room wasn't available. The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available. I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel. Want internet? Upcharge. Want extra pillows? Upcharge. Extra coffee for the room? Upcharge. Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating. I won't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking."
"DO NOT STAY HERE!! My wife and I were visiting family in Chicago and decided to stay at the James. We had stayed at the James in New York happily so we came in with good expectations. What a mistake. Our room looked nothing like the ones pictured on the website. The bathroom was dirty and the bedding and furniture were disheveled. There was also a musty odor to the room. When we called the front desk to complain they were quite rude. We ended up leaving and staying in a different hotel for the duration of our stay."
"When we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago, we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced. Our room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby. And finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor. The room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day, it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side. Our experience was definitely not a pleasant one. To make matters even worse, we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left. I am never coming back to Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel."
"For the amount of money per night that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel charges, one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom. The toilet wouldn't flush, the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking. When I called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet, the staff were indifferent. It was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures, and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink. All in all, I was disappointed with my stay."
"After a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel. The problems started in the parking lot, yup before I even got in. There was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage, broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble. Upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room. The elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out. The hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking. When in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed, the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on. This was only the beginning of our terrible stay. Guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long. The maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass. We could not check out soon enough! We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip."
"I had such high hopes when I booked a stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago a few short weeks ago. When I arrived I should have known things would not be as I expected them to be. The host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that I was there. When I finally got checked in and arrived in my room I found that the temperature in the room was far too hot. The air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot, muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room. I turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down. Since I arrived in the early afternoon I decided to order room service from the Nix Restaurant that is in the hotel, I ordered the Gooey Triple Decker Grilled Cheese, at $14 I was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich I had ever eaten. When it finally arrived, more than an hour later, it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey! It also comes with a bowl of Tomato Bisque soup which, needless to say was also cold. For the quality of the food, $14 was way too much to pay for this meal. After a meeting with clients we stopped by the Martini Bar for drinks. The waitress was rude and seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to serve. Needless to say it took forever to get our drinks. We heard other patrons grumbling about the amount of time it took for the drinks to arrive as well. Finally we got our drinks, we all ordered a French Martini. We all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered, it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very, very tart. At $14 each you would think it would be made to perfection, far from it. The evening finally over I went back to my room where I now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have. After a miserable night I checked out glad to be done with the Knickerbocker Hotel!"
"When I arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I was shocked at the poor and dangerous neighborhood it was situated in. This was not the Chicago I was hoping for.In addition to that, it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website. The paint was faded and chipped, there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of. After we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk, someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name. After a long trip, I'm sure you know how aggravating that was. Finally I got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation. Once we got to our room, it was very small, smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood. Also, as we were walking to the room in the hallway, a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place. To top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night. All we heard was lots of frighteningly loud love making and arguments ensuing that even a television could not mask. It was a nightmare. Oh yeah, and the shower did have any hot water. We complained to the desk and they said that it was not there fault and that it would be fixed my next week. When we asked for a discount they said that there were no refunds and that we could leave whenever we wanted."
"While the hotel certainly seems to look beautiful, the hotel is actually far from it. Even booking a room online was rather difficult, and i wasn't able to reach a representative upon calling any of the contact numbers. In general coming here is a bad decision despite how it looks, its a mistake i wont make again and you shouldn't either."
"Superhigh Bill at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago My wife and I decided to take a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary. I told my wife that I would take care of everything. I booked the Millennium Knickerbocker because it had a great location, it was reasonably priced for a 4 star hotel and had spa features. The hotel loby seemed nice enough and the staff seemed fine. The problems for us started when we went to our room. I have sinus problems, so I didn't notice the smell in our room, and my wife didn't say anything to me because she wanted to go with the flow and not ruin our weekend. We couldn't find the remote for our television and we didn't call down, we were trying to be good sports. We were both disappointed when we realized that our hotel didn't have a pool or hot tub, swimming and relaxing in a hot tub is one of the reasons we go on vacation. Upon checking out I was hit was 250 dollar fee for smoking in our room. My wife and I don't smoke and there was nothing we could do to get out of the smoking fee. If that wasn't bad enough we were hit with a 50 fee for the missing remote control."
"The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel has seen better days. I had fond memories of staying there when it was considered the finest hotel. I booked a room to celebrate a special occasion and found a highly-priced, not so great property. I had to look at five suites before I found one where the upholstered furniture was to my liking, some of the other rooms carpet was not clean, the refrigerator was dripping water, and the balcony was littered with cigarette butts. I finally settled for a room, only because the bellman was friendly and apologetic but as over priced as it was I should have turned around and walked out. I sent a letter to the management when I returned home, but it had been a month and I never received an answer. There are plenty of other places to spend your money. Don't leave it at this hotel."
"I had wanted to stay in this hotel since I had heard about how historic it is and I was highly disappointed with my stay there. The room that I was given was dirty and when I went back to the front desk to inquire about it, they disregarded my concerns. It took them a very long time to get me a new room and they whole time they were very unprofessional and did not make me feel welcome. I did not stay in the hotel all night since the people in the rooms around mine were unruly and were making noises all night long. I left that night but not before demanding a refund."
"Although the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago claims to be an affordable upscale hotel in the heart of Chicago, it is somewhat expensive, starting at $200 per night. There are very few special discount rates available for the budget conscious traveler. The rooms are modern looking and a little less cozy than one might prefer. The carpeting in the rooms is a little outdated and somewhat dirty in a few areas. The views from the rooms are not as great as they could be. The hotel seems to be understaffed and the heating unit in the room is hard to adjust to the right temperature. Although the hotel is located on Chicago's famous Michigan Avenue, it is a $40 taxi ride from O'Hare airport and a $36 taxi ride from Midway airport, both rather pricey options. If you chose to drive there, the valet parking charge is a hefty $53. Again, not very budget friendly. All in all, even though the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago is close to some of the major Chicago attractions, it is only an average hotel on many levels."
"A recent stay at the James Hotel-Chicago, revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. Although the rooms and public areas look nice, the hotel still needs serious work. Our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. We asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. We had to involve the Manager before our request was granted. The new room was better at first glance, but was severely lacking. We could not get the temperature properly regulated. The room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. In a hotel commanding the rates of the James, we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted, not something which is a constant battle. Our mattress was horribly uncomfortable. When the rooms were updated, the James skipped new mattresses. Ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can't get out of--when you lie down, you sort of sink into a hole. This matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury' hotel. Last, but not least, we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. In spite of the calming decor, the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night's sleep. All in all, we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. You will be happier almost anywhere else."
"We stayed in the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago in a standard guest room. The rooms had just been renovated, but the changes did not make much of a difference. The room was so small, it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat. The decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room. We were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room, but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us; there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers. We called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them. It would not have mattered if they sent a second set; the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers. As hotel guests, we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for. We were severely disappointed."
"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is one of the worse hotels I have stayed in. Everything from the lobby to the staff to the room experience was horrible. As I walked in to the lobby, the lobby had a fowl smell, similar to rotten eggs. The staff wasn't much better, especially room service, where it took over 30 minutes just to make my request for more towels. The baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out, they almost just refuse to provide service. The room I stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures. The windows were dirty and I couldn't see anything outside the window. The room smelled like someone soiled the room and there were ants crawling on the tabletops. If I had to give any suggestion on this hotel, you should just avoid this hotel all together. Even a cheap motel has better standards than this hotel."
"This hotel is overpriced. One should pay money for luxury, but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge. When you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because, yes, they do have to make money. But the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me. When I got there and went to my room, I thought that there would be nice colors, a great view, and deluxe bedding. What I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target--they were not cheap, but not that expensive either. I think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid."
"I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and there is no way I'll be going back. Check in took a long time as there many people arriving for a conference and only a single staff member at the reception desk. My room itself was barely passable - the bathroom seemed to need a good cleaning and the room itself looked like it had seen better days long before I ever was here. For the price I was paying, you'd think they'd allow access to the work out facilities, but they wanted an outrageous PER DAY charge! Top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you won't want to be spending any time here at all. To top it off, the promised discount rate wasn't honored at the end of my stay, despite being assured that all was well at check in! I ended up arguing with the manager about it when I was checking out - since I had to catch a flight, no resolution happened and as of yet, I'm still waiting for responses to my calls and letters. Chicago has a lot better hotels to offer and for the price per night I paid, it wasn't worth it. Even the Shula's wasn't enough to make me want to return here."
"I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel. It was my first time staying at this hotel and, I am sorry to say, it was my last time staying there. One of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise. The walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking. Although I could not quite make out the words of their conversations, I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. In addition, I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door, presumably on the way to their rooms. Admittedly, I am a light sleeper, but this was ridiculous. If you decide to stay here, I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. When I checked mine, I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged. I had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me (and the front desk service is woefully slow) and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. Finally, though I had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated, I cannot believe that statement was accurate. The room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn. All in all, I round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing. Next time I will arrange to stay elsewhere."
"The Sheraton Chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience Chicago. There are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do, and there aren't even any shuttles that will bring you around town. The food in the restaurant at the Hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries, and makes no attempt to emulate the Chicago culture. There are a million other hotels in Chicago, and this is one of the most average. The rooms are fairly decent sized, but they lack amenities like wi-fi and mini bars. The view is nothing special, and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls."
"My husband and I made a reservation at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, for a much needed weekend getaway. We took off work early Friday to beat traffic. Once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking. We drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel. Upon checking in we were informed that the floor, where our room was located, was in the process of having the carpets cleaned. We decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation. We took the elevator, which smelled like urine, up to our room. We did see some carpet cleaning machines, unattended, in the hallway. I hoped for the sake of safety, no children were staying on this floor. We walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine. The overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us. We called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms. He rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings. Just then, the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and I could not hear anything else my husband said. We decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel. It was an awful experience."
"For the price, you would think this would be a top quality hotel, but it was nowhere close. Service at check-in was slow and unfriendly. The room was even worse. It was small, dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though I had requested a non-smoking room. The cover on the bed was stained, there was hair all over the bathroom floor, and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall. Everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel. I also didn't appreciate having to pay for wifi, when other premium hotels offer it for free. Overall, this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in a long time, and considering the price, it was terrible."
"This might be a classy looking hotel in downtown Chicago, and while the location is not bad, the rooms are definitely hit or miss. They range from the super basic "affordable" room to the presidential and huge suites that only presidents could probably even afford. With so many different room options, it's no wonder they have difficulty honoring your exact reservation if you check-in past 4:00 pm. The hotel has a decent pool, but the health club is extra per day, as are many other services at the hotel. You'd imagine that for the price of a stay here ($160 up to multiple hundreds) that more things would be included! Additionally, the check-in staff was a bit snobby and unhelpful. I really would expect great service for the high price of a stay here. If I were to return to Chicago again, I'd definitely try out staying somewhere else."
"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers in December of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever. First, when I went to check in, I was completely ignored by the staff, they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in. When I got to my room, all the way on the 23rd floor, the room was dirty and had not been cleaned. So back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room. I went back to check and the new room was dirty also. There were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom. It appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean. All I can say is YUCK! My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN! Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms. I felt like I was staying at a $30 a night roach motel, not the $250 a night Sheraton. My advise is to stay away."
"The hotel was not one of the better ones I stayed at. the room was seemingly nice at first, but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it. I had the same sheets for a three days before I called and requested they be changed. Also, the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms, which interfered with my sleep. I ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also, and asked for a well done steak, and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor. This is definitely not a hotel I would recommend to anyone."
"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago hotel for a business meeting and had an absolutely horrible experience. When i arrived, exhausted after a series of delayed flights, I was told that my room was not ready. Not ready at 5pm, are you kidding me! After waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes I was finally called over to the desk only to be told my king room was changed to a room with two queen beds, fine, whatever. I get up to my room and unload all of my bags only to find my a/c doesn't work. I call down to the desk and the clerk tells me that they are sold out and there is no where to move me but she could discount my rooms $20. No apology. Nothing. Im exhausted and deal with my 80+ degree room. When I went to check out the next morning I find out no one even bothered to apply the discount. Again, no apology. I have never received such poor customer service in my life and will not be comming back."
"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers recently, and I was completely dissatisfied. When I arrived the clerk was very rude to my guest and myself. We finally got all of our things figured out and went to our room. There is a river right outside and i constantly heard boats passing by. My bathroom was disgusting and not to mention, very small. I did not have a very pleasant experience at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers."
"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is not the hotel for persons wishing to have a relaxing getaway. Upon entering this hotel you have the impressions that it is a warm and inviting place. One encounter with the staff will change this point of view immediately. the person who assisted us was not very knowledgeable with his duties and did not provide the overall attention required or expected. Everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication. Training for the staff should be conducted immediately in order to match classy look of the hotel with their interactions with the customers. I am truly diappointed with the fact that my stay at this hotel was as substandarded as it was. I was so looking forward to a wonderful stay at your establishment. I hope that the issues mentioned earlier are resolved. However, I do not plan to return to this hotel again."
"I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied. I arrived to find that they had "lost" my reservation. They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation. After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in. He was almost helpful. He searched the database and found that there was a "cancellation"; however, it was not for the type of room I had reserved. I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days. I was given a box with a bed in it. They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation. Unfortunately, I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked. I had no choice but to accept what they had offered. I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here. Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything, even if it was their error."
"Stay away from this hotel. A few months back me and my wife decided to get out and have a nice pampered away from home weekend. Looking at different options for this weekend we decided to go with the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. They claim " Experience the extraordinary " and this sounded great. When we arrived at hotel we were met buy a closed front door and nobody to help with bags. The front desk clerk explained that our room was not yet ready and to goto the bar for some complemenatry drinks. After waiting 2 hours for our room we finally can start to relax. Well upon entering room the smell of something horrible is overwhelming . The front desk informed us there was no other rooms and they would bring up some air freshner. We packed our bags and headed over to "x" hotel and were able to get to our pampered weekend away from home."
"I booked my room at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers somewhat reluctantly; I was not enthusiastic about spending over $200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once again when I arrived at my room. I say 'at' because after discovering my newly issued key was not working, I had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in. The room was painfully small-- if I didn't know better I would have thought I was staying at a Red Roof Inn! The "sweet sleeper bed" had stiff and scratchy sheets, with a cheap-motel-thin coverlet. The disappointment continued after I entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke, but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible. I stayed my two nights, and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room (for which I was not responsible), charged on demand movies, an empty mini bar, AND for smoking in the bathroom. HAH! I have stopped payment on my credit card, and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again."
"I was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton, but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment. It started with check in; I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed, but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms (OK, rather rudely!) that because of some banker's convention that was going on, I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left. It was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience! The room itself was OK, nothing special though. The cleaning staff must've just been through, because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air. The internet jack wasn't working. It took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it, no apologies given. For the price, I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton. I guess they're really no better than anyone else these days!"
"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice, but it certainly does not "exceed expectations" as touted on their website. Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler. "Chic but not fussy" is an overstatement. The room was clean, although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it hadn't been cleaned since the last guest. There was hand lotion and shampoo samples, but no soap sample. The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed. "Cheap" might have been a better adjective. Check out was simple and not much hassle. Overall, the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch, but next time, I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room."
"My family and I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers with the belief our stay would be a 5 star experience. That was the farthest thing from the truth. The staff was very rude and unhelpful. The hotel is so large that you will get lost if you dont have the help of the staff. Once we did find our room our card would not get us in and we had to start all over. So overall it took over an hour just to get us in a room. As we entered the room we noticed a foul smell that we just overlooked because we were happy to just finally be able to rest. My wife went to the bathroom, and to our amazement there was what appeared to be dog hair all over the tub and tile floor. That was just the beginning of our bad stay. After being in the room for about 30 minutes, there was a knock at the door that just happened to be the Chicago police. There was a report of the smell of marijuana coming from the room! My family was put through a series of embarrasing questions and actually had our luggage and personal belongings searched. There was a small amount of marijuana found in the drawer of the dresser that we never touched. Come to find out after video surveillance, the cleaning lady was arrested for possession of marijuana. Needless to say, our stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was the worst part of our vacation and I would not recommend anyone to stay at this place."
"I was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago. From the outside it looks like a great hotel, and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy, not what I expected when looked at the website. The front desk staff was nice enough at first, but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra. I mean come on, I'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA? The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation. (Note to self, don't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd.) So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow. I guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview (from some of the rooms) and it seems pretty safe. Other than that I was not impressed for the price - I've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens, a better restaurant, where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour (we stayed two nights and we didn't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5). I guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell. In general it seems lke it's on the decline and the staff knows it, they're just kind of lackadaisical. I wouldn't stay there again."
"I made my reservation at the Hilton Chicago believing I was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities. Unfortunately, my stay at the Hilton Chicago went downhill from the moment I checked in. There was only one clerk at the front desk, and several guests already waiting ahead of me. Once I finally got checked in and located my room, I discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. Finally I made it into my room. It appeared nice enough until I went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. The manager moved me into a new room, so I can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle. Finally settled, I was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning. That is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call I had not requested! Needless to say, my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and I will choose other accommodations for my next trip to Chicago."
"I had a business trip coming up in Chicago and I wanted to stay someplace really nice, cause I had never been there, so made reservations with the James two weeks in advance just to be on the safe side and when I arrived they had no record of it. No big deal, right? They said they would take care of it and get me a room right away... two hours later I'm still sitting in the lobby! Finally I get to my room to try and relax. Everything was nice until I decided to take a shower. I went into the bathroom... no towels, wash cloths, nothing. I called down to the front desk and asked for some, about an hour later someone came up with one. Maybe they were just really busy? Finally I get in the shower and the handle is BROKEN!!! I went down to the front desk and asked for a new room and they started implying that I broke it!!! They said everything was fine with the room earlier that day and that I must have done something to it!!! Leaving that hotel was the easiest decision I made on my whole trip. Two thumbs down!"
"I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. When we arrived at the hotel, the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system (I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it). After speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked. We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically. I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money. I for one won't be going back to this hotel!"
"We planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the Swissotel Chicago. Our fun time was not exactly that. Upon arriving for our weekend getaway, we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite, did not mean a thing. Apparently, there were none of the kids suites available. The kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room: coloring, video games, etc. No one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available. Whatever. So, we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available. Guess what? We spent the whole weekend in the same room. Yes, the staff apologized, but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it. Other than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean. We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel, but I will not be booking a room here again. The staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all."
"While staying at the Swissotel Chicago I experienced some of the worst customer service I have at any hotel. The front desk was extremely rude while checking out, and even seemed to try to hurry us out. The fitness center was always packed and I was never able to get on any of the machines, as was the pool area. While eating at the restaurant, I felt it was a very overpriced meal, but it was very elegant looking. The last issue I had with the hotel was the valet parking, it took them awhile to get my car, and they actually pulled the wrong car around. It was another 10 minutes while I waited for them to sort the issue out. The worst part by far was the customer service, and although the hotel looked nice, it wasn't worth the stay with the way I felt I was treated based on the money I was spending. Next time we are in Chicago, we will be staying somewhere else!"
"The Swissotel Chicago hotel aspires to be a tourist's paradise, a hotel so grand and luxurious that you'd rather stay than return home at the end of your trip. But is it really as magnificent as suggested? True, you can get a massage, the rooms have flat screen T.V.s and iPod docks, heck, there's even a gym. But the truth is, you're really paying much more for a few things you don't really need. The Swissotel attempts to lure you in with their illusions of grandeur, when really, all you're getting is a Holiday Inn style room with fancy wallpaper and the ability to play tunes from your mp3 player. Overpriced dining options are available at the Palm Restaurant. They claim to serve excellent lobster, yet what I ordered was the size of a craw fish, and left the taste of a burnt fifty dollar bill in my mouth. This hotel hides behind a velvet curtain, hoping their facade won't be revealed."
"Swissotel Chicago: Don't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. This hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. Firstly, the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. For example, the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it's support after trying to open them for a city view. The bedroom bed (King-sized) makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. Of coarse, this isn't too bad once you fall asleep, until then, it sucks! In regards to room services, the hotel workers are not all that friendly. They talk to you in a stubborn way, as if they just want to get it done and over with, just to get their pay-check. Yes they do all basic room service orders, but it is not all too friendly. Overall, this hotel has it's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has (which is a bare minimum). With that being said, I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. However, if sub-par service and quality is okay for you, then this hotel could be suitable, however, considering it's prices, you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms."
"I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago while I was on holiday recently and I have to say, that you definitely get what you pay for! I was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised. I was sorely mistaken. The first problem I had was when I got there they told me that they had double booked the suite I had reserved. They gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room. I should have left then but I decided to keep an open mind. After we were all settled in my husband and I went to The Palm restaurant. My husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times. Each time we asked them to fix it, they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff. After dinner, we went back to our room. Just sitting on the bed I knew it would be a long night. The mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them. When I went to the restroom, the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons! My husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one. We just didn't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in. I tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional. He pressed really had and hurt my back. Perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session! For lunch we tried Geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way. I decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later! Once I got sick, I was done. I went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because I was not going to sleep there one more night. I made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable. After a lot of arguing, he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel. This was the worst place I had ever stayed! I think a Super 8 Motel would have been more luxurious!"
"I recently stayed at the Swissotel Chicago with my husband and two children. While the room was comfortable, I did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children. The main reason for this was the dining. While the in house restaurants had children's options, there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal. Anyone with children knows that you don't want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times. This was especially true since we were traveling. We arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed. However, our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants. This was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package."
"What I thought was going to be a romantic Chicago Weekend turn out to be lackluster. The Swissotel Chicago per their website seem to tout itself as a luxury destination well much to my surprise it was not. First my reservation was messed up instead of getting "the classic room with a view" we were put in what I guess is their classic king. The view was nothing to write home about. When I called the front desk to complain about the situation I was told their was nothing they could do since the hotel was booked solid. I asked how could this happen when I got a confirmation? The clerk simply said "probably a glitch sorry is there anything else I can help you with?" At the point I hung up the phone as I knew our romantic weekend with a view was not going to happen. When we checked out I told a manager what happened and He said there was nothing we can do sorry" I expected a little more customer service from them since they think of themselves as a luxury destination."
"Worst high priced hotel I've ever stayed at! I had a business meeting in Chicago and heard good reviews from a few co-workers thought it would be a nice place to stay but was a little upset with my experience with Swissotel in Chicago.Front desk clerk was very rude at check in, valet parking was great until they brought my SUV around front with a quarter size dent in the passenger size door, the hotel refused to pay for the damages. The room was very beautiful besides the faint mildew smell in the room. Room service was great and very pleasing!Our business meeting took place in the St Gallen room where our meeting took a little disruptive turn, there was construction going on during that time and was very hard to hear the announcer in our meeting. Other than that the hotel was beautiful but the stay wasn't as great as i expected, you may want to book somewhere else if you have a business meeting to attend in Chicago."
"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend. It was far from that! We could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain, the person who answered the phone was extremely rude! We were unable to relax at all! Also, the room was not very clean, there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock. We will not be returning to this awful place!"
"The James Hotel in Chicago looks nice on the website, but looks can be deceiving! The employees are extremely rude and the rooms are disgusting. I would definitely advise against staying there."
"I recently was in Chicago on business and chose to stay at the Swissotel, Chicago. The hotel sells itself as being stylish, sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. I would have been better off anywhere else. I was not impressed with the interior, finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. I guess 'stylish' might be modern in some people's minds, but not mine. Also, luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. When I made my way to reception, I hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. I had organized an executive suite as I was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room, and thought the extra space would come in handy. When I proceeded to check in, the girl at the desk told me, while smacking gum, that I had no reservation. I handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong, even though I had spelled it out for her. She then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference, all of the executive suites had already been allocated, but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is a step down from the room I had asked for! Surely if you give away my room, you should try to compensate me with something better! I said that no, I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office, and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available, and that if I wanted to switch the following evening, I would be welcome to do that. The room was ok, although, again, I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. I did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services, but found them sadly lacking. Some comments on the services: the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect, and also a per day fee which borders on extortion! There was free wifi in the lobby, but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air, plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. I did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels, but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. The fitness center and pool which I was looking forward to using, were closed for cleaning when I went up. Breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items, which is not what I would have expected for the money. All in all, I would say your money is better spent elsewhere."
"I recently had the misfortune of staying at the Swissotel Chicago hotel in Illinois, and it was one of the worse travel experiences I have ever had! First off the shuttle that was suppose to pick us up at the air port was late by over an hour! Then when the bus finally came, the driver was nice enough but it was clearly his first day on the job since he got lost going back to the hotel. Finally when we got to the hotel they didn;t seem to have our reservation for the 2nd room. (my wife and I stay in one room, our teenage girls usually stay in their own room.) So after the very rude clerk at the corner did nothing to help us we were forced to pack into one room. we would have rented another room but they had no vacancies left. They hotel did have a large occupancy rate, but that only slowed up everything else. our room service was late almost everytime we ordered, and the hotel restaurant never had a wait less then 45 mins. The quality of the room was fair enough, but it was almost impossible to get room service, we could not get fresh towels for almost 2 days! We were suppose to stay for a week, we left after 4 days and found a different hotel to stay at. I would not recommend this place to anyone! stay away!"
"I was very disappointed with this hotel. I have stayed in other Swissotels and enjoyed them very much, but the service can only be described as aloof. There was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure, and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information I had given her minutes ago. Precise, indeed. Room service took forever to pick up (good sign in a way=busy because they are good), but the food arrived very late and very cold. The man tried to replace it, but than took another hour, and I was never given a price reduction, free dessert, or anything to apologize. As for cleanliness, they must be next to godly, as they knocked on my door at 0800, despite the fact I had a doorknocker requesting no service (I'm a late sleeper.) Very disappointed with my stay. This hotel clearly did not help build the chain's reputation."
"I received the type of room that I had reserved. Cleanliness seems to be an issue with the maid staff. The carpet had debris and the bathroom needed attention. Room service was adequate but not great. The walls seem to be paper then as I heard one neighbor's TV for most of the night and the other neighbor's late enjoyment."
"I stayed at Swissotel Chicago for 1 night while on vacation with my girlfriend. Our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate. We walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in, we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel. Once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention, she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault. Needless to say I will not be staying here again."
"Chicago is my favorite city visit. I wanted to share this special city with a new love and booked us a room at the Swissotel. It is advertised as close to downtown and close to the museums of Chicago. I wanted to share my new love. It was indeed close to the museums but to get to either the shopping district or the Chicago Art Institute it was a long walk, full of detours, and it was not easy to grab a cab. While the rooms seemed to be luxuriously decorated the beds were uncomfortable and the rooms just were not very clean. The Room Service was slow, the food arrived cold, and the total experience was way so expensive for what we got. I do not think I have ever experienced the level of noise in such a "grand hotel" as the Swissotel seems. I would not recommend the Swissotel because disappointment, noise, and cold food should just not cost that much."
"Grant it, this hotel seems very nice, but I was not at all pleased with my stay here. The customer service was horrible. I had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either. For as much as I paid to stay here, you'd think the least you'd get is an iron. Not! I had to request an iron, too! In addition to all of the failed amenities, I was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and wasn't reimbursed until an entire week later. The next time I choose to visit Chicago, Swissotel will be the last place I think to stay."
"I booked a room at Swissotel Chicago because I thought the price was reasonable, and at the base price it was; however, it ended up costing more than I had planned for, as you have to pay for parking and other amenities. The service was not very good, considering they market themselves as a luxury hotel. There was no one there to help us bring in our bags when we had a difficult time doing so, and the staff were cold. All in all, I would say it was an average experience... not luxurious like they claim it to be."
"My husband and I arrived at the Swissotel Chicago to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary. We automatically thought our experience would be nice because the pictures on the website and the hotel's brochure intrigued us. Boy were wee wrong! Upon arrival (at the given and advertised check-in time) our room was not ready. We waited for more than an hour, with our bags in hand. We checked more than twice to see if the room was ready, but the staff was less than "warm" both times. After a few frowns and mumbles from the people at the desk in the hotels' lobby, tired and finally arriving to our room, we expected to take a nap and hit the city. We reserved the premier Corner King or so we thought. We were supposed to be able to see the lakes and rivers and the skyline. Yeah, right! All we saw were the brick side of the other side of the building. In addition, the water in the shower had little pressure. We called the front desk, the phone rang for 21 times before someone answered. My husband said that he thinks that they knew we were the people calling. We requested a better room, but they said that none was available. However, they did have an upgraded room, but we would have to pay some sort of upgrade fee. We could not believe it. My husband felt that we should not "agitate" them any further, for fear that they might make things even worse for us: like turn off our air. We threw on some more jeans and headed fro the coffee shop around the corner that had given us refuge before. After returning about 2 hours later, the water pressure was fixed. The room was clean and the bed was plush, but the overall experience (especially the rudeness of the staff) was not good. Let's just say that on our next 13th anniversary we won't stay at the Swissotel and will tell others to not stay there."
"I had really high hopes for this hotel. The location seemed great and the prices were too. Unfortunatley, you get what you pay for. Despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier, there weren't many other redeeming qualities. The staff was very rude. We arrived late after a long drive from Detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in. Once we finally got checked in, our room hadn't been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people. We were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they couldn't get to it until morning! We had planned on seeing some of Chicago's attractions like the Field Museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go. Their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them. Finally, when we checked out, they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night. RIDICULOUS!"
"The James Chicago hotel was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The only good thing about it was that it was located downtown, so I wasn't forced to stay in it any longer than I had to. The receptionist was rude and snobby, my room had dirty towels in it, and i found numerous small insects in my room. Furthermore, the gym and spa were closed while I was there. Nothing was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences. Next time I will take my business elsewhere."
"The Swissotel Chicago is a very mediocre hotel, the service is always poor, and the room service food always comes cold, unless it's supposed to be cold than it comes warm. I would rather stay at a super 8 than this place again."
"I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife. I was on business but I thought I'd take her so we could see the city as well. Chicago was great, The Allegro...not so much. I mean it looked nice, great lobby and all. The service wasn't so great though. The clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude. Like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend. The bell hop took our bags to our room, none to gently. My wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room. Which wasn't that bad till he actually asked for a tip! Our room was okay. The bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved. The next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasn't cleaned. Our trip to the Chicago had it's nice moments, all outside the hotel. The Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better. I won't stay there again."
"I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago while on a business trip. I have to say that I was very displeased with the service i received during my stay. Even though their website boasts that their staff will be at your beck and call, i found them to be very rude. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the noise level very high. I was awakened by guests in the next room several times. Even though I complained to the front desk, they did not resolve the issue. I definitely would not recommend this hotel and I will be staying at a different hotel if I am in the area again."
"I recently visited Chicago. I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago. First of all I did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel. My hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast. The food served was not up to par I felt like it was a cheap "free" lunch. My room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them. My toilet paper row was half way finished when I checked in. I felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room. I did not feel safe, I had to hide my valuables and I kept the "BUSY" sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff. The rooms did not appear as they do on their website, it is actually the opposite. Looked to me like a regular motel inn but I paid way more than I would have at an actual motel inn. I did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip. I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone."
"I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter. I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels. I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation. Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way. I booked the hotel stay for over a week, which was very expensive, and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL, despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well! They did nothing to accommodate me, and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she "didn't know the area" To tope it all off, the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it. Worst hotel experience of my life, I will never go back. - Sandy D."
"I was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel. The overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance. Given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level, this was most disappointing. Nor was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff."
"The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop, provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory. We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website, but to our surprise when we arrived, our names were nowhere to be found in their system! No room, no accommodations at the restaurant, nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot. A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked, and never did they offer us a replacement dining option! I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time. We will never be staying here again."
"My daughter wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago for her 21st birthday recently, and I wanted to find the best hotel for her experience. I looked at the hotel website and really like Hotel Allegro's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services, so I booked us for a Friday and Saturday night. Upon arriving, the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant. Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint, but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy. After check-in, which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing, we headed to our room trying to be optimistic. Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested, the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound, and we only had a stock of 2 towels, which were never replaced during our stay. We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel. It was a huge disappointment, for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl. I highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel. There are much better choices in the Chicago area."
"I arrived at the hotel 15 minutes prior to check in time as they recommend. When I get there I noticed that there is a couple and two other people waiting in line to check in. Ten minutes later after standing there with my suitcase, the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software. She told us to wait until the computers booted back up. I asked if I could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they couldn't activate the cards. Finally another 20 minutes later the computers were up and I finally got my room. Wheres the "luxury" in waiting 35 minutes for a room? They also need to change the name of the hotel because their service did not leave me "allegro.""
"I have been stayed in Allegro for two days. There are not other big prolems but one thing I'm not satisfied with is the light. It is dark in the room. Also in the bathroom, the light is not good. I have to open curtains. I have complained about this to their reception. They said they will fix it, but I did not get any response. I am very disappointed and I will never come back again."
"I was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the James. I had heard from others that it was "agreeable" and "workable" and "all right," or even "a nice place." I figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend. According to the website, I was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and "warm tones." Well, when I arrived, I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. Everything in the front was just a bit too askew. The staff were busy, distracted, inattentive, and in every way keen to show me I was a bother to them. I handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. I also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. It looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before I got there. The bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly, inexplicably, of men's cologne. Nobody cared when I complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just "stuck in my nose" and that it would go away. Well, it didn't, and I had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. This ruined my entire first evening in Chicago. For my price I could have stayed a week at an economy hotel, gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs, and still saved money. And I would not have been treated like such a pest. Needless to say, I will be looking elsewhere when I go back to Chicago. I may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels, but I know when I am wasting my money."
"Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar. The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room. I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby. As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper. She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. I didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered. It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. If my stay wasn't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated. The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online. I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant."
"Your website wowed me enough to book online although I had never used your hotel. I had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to Chicago and I was VERY disappointed. The first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk. We had to wait a long time to get checked in. When we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom. The maid hadn't finished the room and she'd left her stuff behind! Of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle. The next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one. We knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled, non barking pets. This animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep. I called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped. I think the dog just gave up because it didn't sound like the desk staff knew what to do. The crowning disaster, at least for my kids and husband, was that the remote control for the tv was dead. We managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake. Your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great. I cannot recommend it to anyone."
"My wife and I recently stayed at the Allegro hotel in Chicago and were extremely disappointed. It claims to be a luxury hotel, but the air conditioning in our unit wasn't working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow. We phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of. Noone ever showed up. Aside from that, there were so many kids running around we couldn't think straight. This is just my two cents, but I'd would tell anyone considering staying at the Allegro to pass and look at their other options."
"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago this past summer. Needless to say we will not be returning! The Hotel is very overpriced for what you get. Upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had. The bed was very uncomfortable and the "fully-stocked honor bar" was stocked with only a few choices. The shower did not even work!We booked the King Suite with Jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi. I would not recommend this place!"
"I was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Allegro. The front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window. After giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet. This came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began. After waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested. We were informed that they were "only requests" and not a guarantee. Room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed. When we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted. The food took an eternity to reach the room and the order wasn't exactly right either. This is not the kind of service I expected from an upscale hotel."
"My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago. We had been looking forward to a romantic getaway. I have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us. This is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in. But we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given. In the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover. Very shocking for the price we were paying. When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by. Past this - the room itself - it has flair I guess, but I can't imagine it is the right flair for many. The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow, designy wallpaper. Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all. I can't imagine many would. It really was off-putting. Overall, the experience was a check minus in my book. Will not be looking to return any time soon."
"My wife and I were guests at the Hotel Allego in Chicago for a long weekend getaway (September 2 - 5, 2011). We had checked out the hotel's website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip. Once we arrived, the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy. When I asked to be moved to another room (my wife has asthma) we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time. The room was not particularly well-cleaned: we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor, and a film of dust across the television set. We are not the type to complain, so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it. At nighttime when we tried to sleep, we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin, every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly. We were tossing and turning half the night. In the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day, but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated: a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack. The concierge was almost never around in the lobby (her sign always said "Be right back!") and when we did ask her questions, she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us. The second night was without incident, luckily, except for the terrible bed, but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our "Do Not Disturb" sign. I would not recommend this hotel."
"This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere. It smells because pets are allowed. This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed. There was mold in our room and bathroom, pet hair everywhere! Kids love pools. How can they claim to be kid friendly without one? My kid was bored. The food was basically the same every day, no variation in the menu. Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their "travel club" because our room didn't even remotely resemble the pictures. They did the old bait and switch. We reserved a "family room". When we opened the door of our room, we realized that it wasn't what the website pictured or had what the website described. We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers. Definitely do not recommend this hotel!!!"
"While the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside, my experience went downhill once I walked in. The lighting is very poor, which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere. The mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay. I definitely would not stay here again."
"Since this was our first visit to the "windy city," we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique. We read many great reviews regarding the Kimpton brand so we gave it a go. The "go" ended up being a "no go." We were sorely disappointed. When we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice. We have two kids with us, so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby. We were told "no problem." Unfortunately, it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next. Then, we noticed a bug (or bugs) near the fridge area. Yikes! We called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room (or floor!). Our request was met about 30 minutes later. By this time, we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions, we almost wanted to throw the towel in. Customer service was so lacking! We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city, but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. This is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price! Will have to think hard before we book with a Kimpton hotel again."
"When you stay at a hotel like The James, just from their price point, you expect a certain level of quality. If I pay well over 500 dollars for a room, I do not think it unreasonable to expect not only a quality room, but also a certain level of standard of service. Perhaps this hotel should rename itself The Lebron James, because it has about as much class as he does, and is about twice as pretentious. A handful of baby powder thrown into my face would have been a refreshing break from the level of service I received at The Lebron James. My night of hell began with the clerk, bellboy, or whatever he was, at the front desk, who faked what I assume was intended to be a British accent, but ended up as an unholy melding of Australian and New Englander. A British accent does not make you fancy, or skilled. Once I made my way past Mr. Belvedere and to my room, I was disappointed, not only by its size, which was unusually small, but also a faint scent of cigarettes. Not a strong one, but I could definitely smell smoke. Not acceptable. Then, while I was sleeping, a deep throbbing sound began to emanate from the walls. It sounded technical, mechanical, like an air conditiner malfunctioning. Despite many reassurances from the front desk, the throbbing continued on throughout the night. I demanded the man at the front desk come up and rectify the situation immediately, but from what I could tell, he never came."
"This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be. The website and it's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in. The amenities were not what I was looking for, and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there. My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area, and they were not very prompt when responding to requests. I understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there, but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service. I don't think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon."
"My recent stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago couldn't have gone worse. Apart from the price of staying there and the slow response time of hotel staff I was totally let down by the food that could be found there. There are many attractions in the area and indeed leaving the hotel is the best part of the experience."
"The Amalfi Hotel Chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay. When arriving at the hotel my party and I had over a 20 minute wait just to check in. We were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their "private" counter that their website highlights. It felt as though I was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in. Not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever, but our reservations were completely wrong. I ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when I had reserved a smoking king room. Not having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel. I was not compensated for having to switch rooms and Audrey our Experience Designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze. I recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area. The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is a waste of time and money as far as I am concerned especially when I could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort. Don't waist your time staying here."
"I recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. Although I visit this fun city quite often, I was somewhat disappointed with the service and noise in a hotel that is called "luxury boutique". To begin with, our "Experience Designer" was somewhat put-offish and cool. She did not really have a grasp of all the wonderful things to do in Chicago. Although she did look up some attractions, it seems like she may have recently arrived from LA. As far as the room, it was indeed luxury and had nice lighting and decoration. However, the noise from the adjoining room was unbelievable and kept us up all night. Most likely, the walls are very thin, and construction is not the greatest. Who wants to hear the neighbors, especially when they are honeymooners or whatever! So we probably will not stay there again. The location is great, the cocktails fine, the luxury is there, but other than that, it is the pits. Weary Traveler, San Francisco"
"First stepping foot on the hotel propety I could tell it was a negative place, Seeing as how there was what apperd to me to be Vice Lords all aroung the property. Not that i have a personal problem or affelated with another gang, It's just the way they was acting, drinking the hotels cheepest wine, they could of been there for securaty purpouses like the hell's angels was to some concerts. Walking in the hotel i oder hit me. It smelled like a cretan type of burning wood that i have smelled, only later to find out it was the smell of rock cocine. I looked at the pool only to find there was no watter and scateborders all around the place. Me being a high class bizness man, I decided to leave."
"The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly, yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly. The staff seemed miffed and stuck up, and I had to wait for the personal check in. I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited, and other guests (all single or couples without children) seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in. This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two, even though it is advertised as such. I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising, Amalfi."
"The Amalfi Hotel advertises itself as a "luxury boutique hotel" and as such I expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The room I booked was not clean; in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest. There was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned. In addition, although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room, I could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke. I will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants, sites and shops all within walking distance. However, given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room, I would not stay at the Amalfi Hotel again."
"I recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago. Sure, it looks nice, but it's really just a smoke screen. I went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me. I was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else. She also encoded my key wrong, so I had to have it redone. I finaly get to my room, only to discover it was a mess. The sheets were thrown on the floor, the curtains were wide open and to top it all off, the toliet hadn't been flushed. It was horrible. I called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up, but I was told they were on break. Whatever thoguh, I cleaned up myself. The night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door. Some guy said that I was in HIS room. It baffled me, but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up. They had given his the wrong room. I couldn't take one more day of all the bull. I checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago. I would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE."
"This hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. The Amalfi Hotel Chicago advertises itself as a "luxury hotel" located in downtown Chicago. Since it is in downtown Chicago, that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night. My view also suffered. They had nicer rooms available with better views, but the markups to stay in them was outrageous! The room itself was decent, with clean linens and nice air conditioning, but I can get that in just about any hotel these days. There wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me, but for the price I paid for the room, I certainly had that expectation. It was a let down."
"Don't let the website fool you. I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago on my last business trip, and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel I've ever stayed at. The website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it's more on par with a 2 stars or 3, if you want to be generous. First off, the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture. The room that I checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls, and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since god knows when. Since I was only staying one night, I decided not to ask for a different room- although I don't know if asking for a different room would've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. When I arrived, there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement, no prompt service. I had to wait about 3 minutes although I was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. And no, they weren't talking about hotel matters. I'm not a difficult or an especially picky person, and who doesn't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism. Do yourself a favor, and go stay at the Marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for."
"Recently stayed at the James Chicago and will NOT be returning anytime soon. The staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous. Also not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests. There wasn't enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely. Ultimately i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment."
"i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in Chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning. the girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me. the room wasnt at all what i was expecting. it was dingy, dirty, and just seems like an old hotel. just not what i was looking for in a nice hotel. seemed like the quality you'd expect from a cheap motel."
"The service was only subpar and then rooms needed better cleaning. I was at the check in counter longer than expected because they decided to use a trainee to check me in, definitely no fun after such a long flight. There were no clean towels in the room and my bill was returned with room service charges of which I did not order."
"As a former Chicagoan, I'm appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. First of all, I was expecting luxury and hospitality, neither of which I received. There's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a "personal concierge," but my experience with my ED was terrible. I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to. Not only that, but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. When I finally got to my room, I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. On top of that, the bed was messily done; I could have done a better job on my own bed at home. I was angry at this point, because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi, and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. When I finally checked out of the Amalfi, I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel. I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away!"
"I had the misfortune of being booked at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago a few weeks ago. What a joke. To start off, the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed. I don't know who made the bed up in my room, but it could have been done better by my 7 year old. Ditto the bathroom. Water spots, soap scum and (ugh) hair of ALL kinds in the sink, tub and about the floor. GROSS. I requested non-smoking, either they didn't listen or didn't care, but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray. The "beautiful view" was ruined by water spots - not outside(which is forgiveable) but INSIDE! And they were sticky. I stayed only one night. The Holiday Inn had rooms available, and they were clean. Never Again."
"Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at. I travel a lot for my job, and it just so happened that this was the hotel the company was paying for. Four star hotel? Yeah right! I wish I could give it negative stars I don't even know where to begin. Normally with these reviews I try to outline the aspects that stood out, but it's just so overwhelmingly bad. Anyhow, here it goes: To begin with, the customer service stank. You think you've seen rude service people before? Well, this is customer service stuff of nightmares. I had a reservation, but I still had to wait for 30 minutes (yes, I counted) for someone just to pay attention to me. When she did, finally, she was chewing gum. No visible uniform or name tag. Clearly didn't want to be here. She took one glance at my reservation, didn't enter anything into the computer at all, and told me that they couldn't accept it, because the date had already passed. WHAT? The date for the reservation I had written down was *that day.* I was furious. After a 20 minute shouting match, and an equally incompetent manager that left me so angry I could scream, they finally, grudgingly accepted my name and reservation into the computer, so that I could book my room. Then, there was the room itself. On first glance, it appeared clean, but a closer inspection revealed: black mold on the bathroom ceiling, a sink tap that gushed rusty-looking *brown* water, a minibar which was picked at, the remnants looking like they had been there for several years, and a mattress with a mysteriously disgusting yellow stain on it. The pillowcases also looked yellowed, but I couldn't decide if I was beginning to see things, I was already so upset with the place. After an extremely sleepless night of paper walls and neighbors who were, apparently, elephants, I can easily say that I would NEVER go back to that hotel again. Ever. Not if somebody payed me."
"I needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one. First of all the prices for one night are extremely high. The workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities. Then i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep. Also the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting. The beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all. Overall i am very disappointed with this hotel."
"My experience at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was not very pleasant. When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by our "Experience Designer" who was not the friendliest of people. Also, me and my husband tossed and turned all night on their very uncomfortable bed. For the price, I would have expected a more luxurious experience."
"When my husband and I went to Amalfi Hotel we were expecting first class service. First, when we got there we learned they had given our room to another guest and we were not able to get a suite like we had booked. Room service took forever and the food was subpar. Supposedly they had planners to help explore the area, but we requested one and never saw hide nor hair of a planner. The spa staff seemed incompetent. The only positive things I can say about Amalfi Hotel was that the rooms were stylish as advertised. I give this hotel two stars."
"I was highly disappointed with my choice to stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. I had to travel for business at the last minute but felt lucky to get a reservation at such a highly rated hotel. The initial impression was that the desk clerk thought I was lucky that he was waiting on me. I had several questions about local attractions and he acted as though I was bothering him. I was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter. On the plus side the room was lovely, but when I called for room service at 9:30pm I was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm. I decided to go out rather than fight the issue. The next day the tone was the same at the pool, the bar, the restaurant etc. The staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do. The only exception was the housekeeping staff. I called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else I needed before leaving. The bottom line is that I booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it. Even though the hotel was beautiful and in a nice location, the atmosphere was not inviting. I'd rather go somewhere where I felt like my money was appreciated instead of staying somewhere that didn't seem to care that I was there."
"The Amalfi Hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating, but that's about it. When my wife and I got here, we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned! The Internet access promised on the hotel's website was down, so I couldn't catch up on any of the business I had intended to do, and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic, like she was sleeping inside a Salvador Dali painting. All in all, this hotel was not worth the money, especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city--something more casual and comfortable would have been better, and it would probably have been cleaner, too!"
"We stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city. Although the hotel looks nice, the service is terrible. The staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all. The room service closes at 8pm so don't plan on getting hungry after that time. Also, even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries. I will never go back to that place"
"My wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this 'Luxury' hotel to any of our friends. Amalfi claims that your stay begins with a 'warm greeting,' but we received the exact opposite. The front desk clerk was rude, sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question, and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. Apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog, who we had to bring at the last minute. The room on the Pet Floor was alright, nothing spectacular, and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. We proceeded to dinner at Keefer's Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. I have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. The next day, I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly, and had to finish some work at our friend's house. My wife had called for some extra towels and pillows, which took about half an hour to receive. She also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. We were set to stay for 3 days, but only managed to stay 2. We will not be staying here again."
"I was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel. The walls were paper thin, and I could hear conversations in the next room. This is not something I would have expected from a higher class of hotel. The room was also smaller than I would have expected for the price. We were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room, something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning. We requested new towels, but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request. The check-in process was frustrating, mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter. I don't know if she was having a bad day, or just happens to be in such a mood all the time, but either way, it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with. Overall, not a pleasant experience. I think next time, we'll choose another hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago."
"We will not be back to this hotel. There are several reasons for this, but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight. Our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it. The room was OK, but the beds were hard and uncomfortable. The room next door had their TV turned up very loudly, and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option. They didn't offer any other solutions. The food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests. Overall, we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago."
"The Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile The outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city. For the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night, you would think they would have a competent parking attendant. I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough. To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork. Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account. I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations."
"I have to agree that the InterContinental Chicago is a nice hotel from the outside. But it is not a nice place to stay if you are planning to visit Chicago. The ambience of the hotel looks bland and they also have the same amenities as other cheaper hotels. You can get an excellent dining experience somewhere for less."
"I stayed at the InterContinental in Chicago for my visit to set up my Daughter's wedding. Nina (Our Daughter) stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched! Well I don't understand why at all. Upon arrival we checked in and met Nina at the "The Bar" (how innovative) and had a light supper. The food was like airline food and cold. The waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet. When he finally came with the check we thought "our light supper" was all too pricey. Then we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 8:00 PM sharp. Not sharp enough. At 8:15 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and wouldn't be able to meet with us tonight. Well that is just great. Over $300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted. No more money will be spent here, I will Guarentee that. Sincerely Mr. and Mrs. Scott Grander Louisville, KY"
"The Intercontinental Chicago was not as great an experience as I was expecting it to be. When I first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system. They then tried to make me book a higher paying room. I ended up having to ask for the manager, who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate. I was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite. I was not doted on as I should have been and found that I had long wait times when I placed an order with room service or needed the concierge. For the price I was paying to stay there I would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service."
"I was on a business trip to Chicago a while back and I had the unfortunate luck of staying at the InterContinental Chicago Hotel. I say unfortunate , because from the first moment I walked in my experience was poor. The front desk made me wait a very long time and I had to resolve an issue with my reservation. My receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that I supply a personal credit card for the room. I understand their precautions but I travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation. Once that was all taken care of (several phone calls later) I was taken up to my room. It was nice and I was glad to finally be there, but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip, even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room. I was very happy I only had to stay there two night because after my run in with the front desk I got the impression that no one wanted to deal with me. I will hopefully not be staying there again, and will suggest that it be avoided by all."
"I recently had a horrible stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago. When I first arrived I was impressed with the architecture and location, but things went downhill in a hurry. The front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though I had reserved a room with two queen beds, they told me that "only king bed rooms were available at the time", and there was nothing they could do about it. The room itself was a nightmare. It smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement. There was also a huge problem with my television, in that it would automatically turn itself off every 15 minutes or so. I complained about these problems, but very little was done. The hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets, but the quality was only marginally improved. Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago. From the pictures I had seen online I had expected a wonderful hotel, but what I actually got was on par with what you would typically find at a rundown interstate motel."
"This hotel has a good name and a good location in Chicago. Unfortunately I was very unsatisfied with this hotel. This is a luxury hotel, so you are paying luxury prices. So, I expect to get my money's worth. Unfortunately that was not the case at the InterContinental. Firstly, my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture. Again, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel, and it's expensive. I shouldn't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty. I also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted. I'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it's a problem in the whole hotel. The building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old. Secondly, I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel's staff. I thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive. Thirdly, this hotel has a lot of additional expenses. I felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got (use of the fitness amenities, internet, etc). When I'm already paying so much for a hotel room, I get very irritated when I feel I'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get. This hotel has a nice looking building, and again, it's in a terrific location. But I really don't think it's worth the expense. There are so many other hotels in Chicago to choose from that are so much better."
"The staff at the James Chicago hotel seemed determined to make my stay a horrible one. When I entered the establishment to check in, I was ignored. The clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me. Thinking room service would be better, I relaxed in my room while I waited for my food. By the time it reached my room, it was cold AND the wrong order. Disgusted, I went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance. All the restaurants the hotel recommended were one-star, and none of my regular channels were on the tv. All in all, it was a bad stay at the James hotel in Chicago."
"I've never written a review before, but I just had to share my experience with Chicago's InterContinental Hotel. I booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife's birthday. We've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and I thought this would be a great experience for us. The horrors started when we first got to the counter. The clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me. We get to our room and the maid hadn't cleaned it yet! We had to wait around for that, so we went to the hotel's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. Finally our room is finished and the the "view" we were promised was non-existent. To top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning. The toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain. A stain! on the sheets. What a waste of money. I pointed this out the concierge and we weren't even offered a refund or discount. Never again."
"This hotel was very poor with customer service. They were so worried about keeping everything up to date and perfect looking in the hotel they rarely worried about their customers, and their guests. I had to ask for my room to be serviced for cleaning, and it took a long time to get a response. Very disappointed."
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend of Sept. 17-18, 2011. When we were planning our vacation, we were impressed with the hotel. The exterior is very lovely and we looked forward to enjoying the view from our room. We first started to wonder if we'd made the right choice when there was no one waiting to help us with our bags. We had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change. This seems like something a supposedly "world class" hotel should be able to avoid. The good: Our room did have a nice view and when I sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud. The shower was very pleasant. The bad: The room was very small and the bed was not the King size we had requested. We felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay. We have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed. The restaurant options were acceptable, although the service was not as excellent as described. Perhaps we expected a miracle that would've changed our minds about the hotel. We were so disappointed by the room and the service at check-in the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted. We usually enjoy partaking of room service, but we decided after a sub par first day we would eat out for the rest of the weekend. Next time, we will look into other hotels in the Chicago area."
"The InterContinental Chicago hotel terrible. First of all, the continental breakfast was a joke. The food was unhealthy and unsatisfactory. After our first night, we expected the maid to come clean up our room. We came back from site-seeing to find that our room was in the same condition we left it in. I will never go back to this hotel again."
"The International Chicago Magnificent Mile is shrouded in glamour, but underneath the facade fades away. The "classical architectural landmark" should be translated to "old and boring. I found this hotel via Google and have regretted it ever since. Room size was small and unaccommodating, and that was one of the newer rooms! Everything was free except for the gym (why that wouldn't be free with the price I paid I don't know). This hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get, and I would not recommend staying there."
"My family and I were in Chicago for a friend's wedding. We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice, but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel. The hotel appeared very nice, and to have all the amenities: Room service, WiFi, clean rooms. Unfortunately, as it turned out, appearances can be deceiving. It begins at the desk, where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring. He said they didn't have any rooms available because we didn't make arrangements. It was getting late, and we had no place to go, there weren't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving. I asked if there was anything he could do, and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy. I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing, the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night. Apparently, our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard, because this room wasn't even clean and the wifi didn't work. We ordered room service, and it never came, even after several complaints. It doesn't end there either; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service. Overall, this was a very frustrating experience, and I wouldn't stay there again."
"My wife and I were excited to visit and shop at Chicago's Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave. We chose the Intercontinental Hotel for it's reputation and location. Man oh man, were we disappointed. The check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. We got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. There were six people in line for her and we had to wait. That was no problem since we weren't on a timetable. When we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the Miracle Mile, she just pointed to the door and said, "It's right out the door." I asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying, "there's no such thing." I couldn't believe her abruptness. We left the concierge stand not wanting to return. Shopping went well and was fun. We returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. We couldn't find a hotel directory in the room. I called the Housekeeping Department and was told, "we're all out of directories here in the office." I asked if they could check a vacant room for one. She said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. I hung up and thought I would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. Guess what? You guessed it, no phone book in the room. I figured we could go get a drink at The Bar, the hotel's 20's themed lounge, and ask the bartender for suggestions. We went to The Bar and there were only three other customers. We sat at the bar and got our drinks. As I was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions, his cell phone rang. He answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. Twenty minutes later, he was still on the phone. Tired and hungry, my wife and I went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from Pizza Hut. Although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable, the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back. A big thumbs down to the Intercontinental Chicago. They need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary."
"Problems started when I booked the InterContinental Chicago online at the hotel's site, and got a server error. Somehow I managed to get my reservation, and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. The server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. I was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and I had trouble getting served. The hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. The health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. And Internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks! Next time, I'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many "server errors"."
"Although the InterContinental Chicago Hotel is located on "The Magnificent Mile," our entire experience as guests there was anything but ....believe me, the "magnificence" ends at the hotel entrance! From check-in to check-out, our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific. First, there was an error with our reservation, and once we got to our room, we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked, so down I trudged to the registration desk--where I had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes--to ask for help. The first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to TV noise coming from the next room; we weren't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls. Then, dog tired the next morning--even though we had hung a "Do Not Disturb" sign on our door handle--in barged the maid all bright-eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand. Following that rude awakening, I was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife, who, upon entering the bathroom to take her shower, was greeted by an incredibly large roach! Breakfast--actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel--were served cold and were somewhat tasteless. We were routinely ignored by the concierge, who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him. Trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in. Of course, there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart. Getting out of the InterContinental Chicago was, believe me, the best part of our experience as guests there."
"Recently stayed at the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile and was a little underwhelmed. It's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating. There is a definite need for some noise control -- everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room. Hearing the plumbing from other guests' rooms was particularly annoying. The fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use (at least it wasn't included with my booking choice). Parking was pretty expensive so if you really don't need it, don't use it. Overall, just dissappointed that the great location wasn't matched with great accommodations."
"After staying at the James Chicago last weekend I can honestly say I will be going for affordability on my next trip. The James Chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected. The chairs in the room looked like something out of Ikea. I love Chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay. I believe I would have been better off and happier staying at the Holiday Inn. You don't always get what you pay for."
"I only stayed here for five days, but I will definitely never be going back. The architecture is kind of cool, but the customer service was very poor. I don't know how much these people get paid, but they must not think it is enough. Breakfast at the The Continental was alright, but it was overpriced. This hotel felt really crowded and the service was impersonal. There are many better places to stay in Chicago."
"This hotel is ok but is not the best for the money. First of all the parking prices are exorbitant. I know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high. Also, the service at this hotel was poor. I felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general, and the staff at The Palmer House seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us. In addition I feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet. Also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you. I would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about The Palmer House."
"A decent place to stay. The people are nice enough, yet the atmosphere was not what I was expecting. The rooms were not very spacious, nor welcoming. So many places to eat, yet the food was very pricey and average. I would stay here again possibly, but I feel like I could find a better option for a better price."
"When I first made reservations at The Palmer House Hilton, I was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website. Little did I know it was going to be a total disaster. First off, my husband and I couldn't find the place. It was our first time in Chicago after all. And when I would call for directions, they just kept putting me on hold. When my husband and I finally arrived, the bus boy was extremely rude. After man-handling our luggage, he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip. Talk about arrogant. The front desk clerk was a little too pushy. My husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sister's wedding, but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room. The room itself was okay, decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you're worth. They even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the "snack bar" and ordered a movie that I've never even heard of! Completely unprofessional. I will never, I repeat, NEVER stay at this hotel ever again."
"I had an awful experience here. The staff were rude and unhelpful. It took forever to check in and when I did, they took a while to even find my reservation. When I got to the room, it was marginally clean and when I complained, they said they were full and could not do anything for me. I would never go back. They are obviously not worried about customer service."
"I would not stay at this hotel again. The rooms had a fowl odor. It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned. The neighborhood was also less than desirable. The housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms. I will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted."
"My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory. I would have expected much for from such a "high end" hotel. The rooms were way over priced, and the service was less than satisfactory. At one point, I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up, and when room service came through, they were still there! On the other side of things, the cup I had left on my desk (which I was planning to use later) was gone. My coffee and my towels were also never replaced. I also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room. Rather, it was a "nominal fee". After paying so much for a room, I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi. My stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for. I will not be staying there again."
"Oh My! More Like A Dank Museum Than A Four Star Hotel! I read so many reviews on this hotel that I was sure my husband and I wouldn't be disappointed on spending our 10th Wedding Anniversary in the heart of Chicago at such a luxurious hotel! All the reviews sounded great so I feel awkward writing this, but I have to be fair - this place was a major disappointment. While the location is superb, the images online must have been taken over 10 years ago because all of the decor when we visited looked very old and faded. I noticed dirt everywhere - the fabric on the furniture was stained, the baseboards and woodwork were scratched and dirty and there seemed to be a smell of mold and mildew that permeated the entire hotel. Even though the food was great, the linens, glassware and silverware were not sparkling - it sort of helped that candles were lit so I didn't focus too much on how dreary and washed out the dining facility was. I didn't realize experiencing history would actually mean staying at a hotel that's living in the past! This was barely a two star hotel and I do not recommend staying here at all."
"I recently stayed at the Palmer House Hilton on a business trip to Chicago. I will do my best to make sure that future employees of my company do I have to stay here. When the reservation was made, an early check-in was arranged -- due to travel arrangements, my travel companion and I were to get to the city in the early hours of the morning. We had arranged an early check-in without having to pay for the night before. There was no fuss raised when we agreed on this and so we assumed it would be fine. When we got there, however, there were no rooms available for us for hours and they refused to keep our bags. We were forced to change clothes and wash up in the public restrooms of the office building where our first meeting took place, and cart our bags around with us. They offered insincere apologies and didn't offer to comp us anything for the inconvenience. The rest of the stay (one night) was nothing to praise. I guess not having bugs would count as positive? I would definitely never recommend that anyone stay here."
"The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me. I chose it because it a Hilton hotel, but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name. My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff. My room might have been luxurious years ago, but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening. The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible. The food served by the room service and at the hotel's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus, and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine. The food simply did not deliver its promises. Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small. The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage, since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions: however, the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by. Overall, this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range."
"The James Hotel in Chicago was a huge let down. I was expecting a truly spectacular experience. On the website it appears to be an absolutely fabulous state of the art hotel. Well, my family's bad experience started right when we walked in the door. It turns out the room we had reserved had been given to someone else, and the man at the front desk was extremely rude. We had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us. The room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they weren't already in the room. The one thing that was good about the place was the fabulous gym. All in all, I feel that we paid way too much for what we got. Next time I will look to stay somewhere else."
"The Hilton family would be outraged after hearing about a recent stay (i.e. nightmare) at the Palmer House Hilton. I arrived 3 days before the National Restaurant Association tade show hoping to beat the crowds and settle in for a long week of trade show business. When I arrived I was greeted or really snarled at by the Clerk. This lady (if one can really call this beast that) was aggressive and rude from the get go. She made a snide comment on the number of bags I had and it was downhill from there. My guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that I had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation. I informed "Brenda" that I had never cancelled my reservation. We had originally booked 2 rooms (one for me and one for colleague) and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later. She huffed and puffed and finally said, oh okay, I read it wrong but we don't have a room for you. My room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day. As a Hilton Honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain, I was furious. She said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked. She left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes, coming back with a smirk on her face. She informed me that I had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100%. The first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the Chicago downtown, closer to the airport or that I could go with another room they had, a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days. I was outraged. No, I'm sorry and certainly the options were horrible. I ended up taking the smoking room where I barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells. Additionally, there was no upgrade at all during my stay there. I was not offered anything to make up for my troubles, their screw-up nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call. The net outcome: I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I'm thinking of shredding my Hilton Honors card. Don't make the mistake of dealing with this property. You will be very, very sorry. Thanks for reading all this. Hopefully it will help someone out there before booking at this joke of a hotel."
"Having traveled to Chicago on business once before, I was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip. After some research, I decided that the Palmer House Hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay. And, in a way, it was perfect -- perfectly awful. After reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotel's website, I was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary. However, my standard guest room, which the hotel's website describes as "deluxe," was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms I had stayed in at budget chain hotels, not pricier historic hotels, such as this one. The carpeting looked dingy, so I had to wear shoes or slippers any time I walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning -- or the horrendous view of a brick wall that I had from my window. In addition, the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long. Everything cost extra, including the gym, the pool and the spa, and the restaurant prices were outrageous. This hotel is overpriced, overrated and definitely subpar. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
"My husband, three year old son and I arrived at the Palmer House Hilton last Friday for a weekend stay. The hotel looked elegant online but included information that also indicated it was child friendly. At the check in the staff was cold and seemed quite annoyed by son who was merely saying hi and asking the name of the person helping us. One elevator was broken we had a long wait for other elevator. The hallway appeared a bit dirty as we made our way to our room. The room was decent. Not deluxe as their website indicated it would be but is was comfortable and the view was good. We had a long day of sight seeing and play on Saturday. As my son was tired, we elected to return to our room and have room service for dinner. There was no children's menu for room service. Only for the restaurant from which the room service came from the same kitchen, what??? We ordered an adult meal. The food arrived an hour later, cold and unappealing. But we at it because we couldn't wait another hour. Although the hotel looks lovely. The service was not very good. Most of the staff was cold and snooty. Except for the cleaning staff who were very nice. It might be ok for a couple or business traveler but do not stay with children. A comfortable motel might be better."
"Upon entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom. After placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet. I immediately called room service and asked for a new room. They apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess. After oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door. She seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it. After the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip. I hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room. I thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod. Yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor. And nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air. When I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own. If I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa. After giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed. Egyptian sheets? Right! All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour. If you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel."
"The pictures on this website sure are deceiving! In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be! The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning! Now, granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip. It wasn't! They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we don't even drink, no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway! They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time, so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip. We had to spend $50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we'd planned! And then it wasn't as good because the tour guide wasn't there and we got lost! My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one. It was terrible! I certainly won't be staying here again!"
"Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint, that is about the only positive of this terible hotel. The guest services were unhelpful at best, and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful. And as for the rooms, small, cramped, and it seemed as if the sheets hadn't been cleaned in the last 5 years. My stay here was distasteful, and I never intend to return, except to ask for my money back."
"Overall, the hotel was okay. Though I did have a problem with the price. The accommodations mentioned on the website were accurate (other than the supposedly luxury mattress, it was not more comfortable than my own mattress!); but this hotel offers nothing more than a much more affordable hotel! There is a difference between the Palmer House Hilton lobby, and your normal, affordable lobby. But, I do not go to a hotel because it has a fancy lobby; I go to get a good night's sleep. When I want to sight see, I go elsewhere. Like I said, overall, the hotel was okay; but it was not worth the price."
"I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton. My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested. I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up. I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener. There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items. Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance. My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up. I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there."
"Our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and, instead of helping, a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us. They had trouble locating our reservation. Our room was tiny! When I'm paying over $400 a night for a room, I expect to be able to walk around in it! The beds were also tiny. The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door. This hotel was probably once beautiful and classy, but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs. Won't be staying here again."
"Though grand and having a brand, this hotel seems to disappoint me on certain fronts. 1. Staff seemed snooty and arrogant. 2. Request for upgrade was fulfilled only after repetitive requests.The initial room was very small. 3. for the cost paid I would expect a coffee maker, free internet service at the least which even regular B&Bs offer. 4.They will levy charges on each and everything.Complete rip off Other things matched the Grandeur.Cleanliness and location was good, but the staff made my stay unpleasant."
"When most people think Hilton, they think luxury. I know I did. I only wish I'd been half right. Upon arriving, I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. Not a very auspicious start, but they did find me another room. Granted, the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. But, fine. I was willing to let this slide. I didn't want to be difficult. In the following days of my stay, it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term, luxury hotel. Noisy neighbors. Rude staff. If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout, I doubt my sheets were changed even once. Next time I'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. The service couldn't possibly be worse."
"The James Chicago is a stuffy, uninviting hotel. If you are looking for all of the comforts of home, do not stay here. The rooms are like boardrooms,not bedrooms. Definitely not a child-friendly hotel. The restaurant on site is also very modern and screams pretentious. I would not vacation here again, especially not with children. They were afraid to touch anything in the whole hotel!"
"The Palmer House Hilton, while it looks good in pictures, and the outside, is actually a disaster of a hotel. When I went through, the lobby was dirty, my room hadn't been cleaned, and smelled thoroughly of smoke. When I requested more pillows, the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she'd send them up. It took over an hour for 2 pillows. This hotel is a good example that what you pay for isn't always what you get. I will not be returning."
"The Hotel Monaco claims to be a "boutique Chicago luxury hotel," but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish. The pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view, but that was certainly not the case for this customer! The decor, which might be "cutesy" or "charming" to some was actually quite tacky and outdated. The bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be "one of the top 40 hotels U.S." Don't be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photos--this hotel does not live up to its billing. You will be disappointed, as was I, if you expect anything more than a run-of-the-mill experience at a merely average hotel."
"The Hotel Monaco is a hotel that some say has "character". I found the decor tacky and had a hard time relaxing in the room designed with clashing colors and "contemporary furniture". I found the fact that you have to be a member of the Kimpton rewards club to get free wi-fi access to be annoying at the least. Because of their pet-friendly policy, our room smelled like a wet dog, and a canine "guest" down the hall kept us up all night with his howling. Perhaps the dog would have howled less if the 24-hour room service were faster. We waited an hour and a half for our order: meaning we did not get our dinner we wanted at 10:00 pm until midnight! All in all, we would not stay here again. The views and location are great, but for the money there are better places to stay in Chicago."
"I stayed here last August and I'm truly glad that I will never have to stay here again. The website does a great job of creating an illusion. The rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website. I thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt. The wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow. For such a "classy" hotel, there isnt a pool. At $46 per night, the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests. All and all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
"If you are looking for a true luxury experience, Hotel Monaco Chicago is not the place to go. I stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience. I did not get it. Check in was not a pleasant experience. The wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. The room was ok, no roaches or anything, but it was small and cramped. And the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel. The house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8:30a in the morning. When I asked them to come back later, they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back. And getting extra towels was like pulling teeth. I don't know if they thought I was going to steal them or what. The room service food that I ordered was fine, but it took forever to be delivered and was half-cold by the time I received it. When I called the front desk to complain, they apologized, but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food. They have a restaurant at the hotel, but I did not bother to try it. The prices were ridiculous, the menu was limited, and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel. I was really disenchanted with this experience. At $400 plus dollars a night, I received mediocre accomedations and poor service. Spend your hard-earned money somewhere else."
"I decided to spend the extra money booking a room at the Monaco because of the website's pictures of the beautiful rooms and views. It was a waste of cash, to say the least. Although I had requested a room with a view of the city, they must have given me the worst room in the place. Maid service skipped over my room on my second day there, and I had to call for towels at least twice before someone finally came to my room. The food was outrageously expensive and not even lukewarm. Two-star hotel quality."
"I arrived to find that my room was not ready, despite it being past the 3pm check in time. I was not offered any compensation for this, or any real apology, just shunted off to the side to wait it out. This took a good hour and a half, during which time I was needing to be reading for a meeting. Again, no apologies, just my card. The room was adequately clean (it had better be...) though sparsely furnished for the price. It did not feel very welcoming and the decoration was reminiscent of bad nights spent in hot, south coastal motels. I encountered several problems with on site amenities, both in room and out. Some staff tried to be helpful on occasion but were rarely able to make headway, even when I complained on the third night about rowdy neighbors. It seemed as if where there was not apathy or cluelessness there was barely concealed surliness. After the abysmal (lack of) service at the hotel bar I elected to eat out every other night (I declined to try the room service, unimpressed with every other offering so far). I would not use this hotel for my business or personal trips."
"I found my stay at the Hotel Monaco - Chicago to be less than satisfactory. They lure you in with a fancy website, promising the world and more, but their services and amenities turned out to be a facade. The pictures on the website show a grand five-star lobby and one would assume the rooms match, but when I received my room (which by the way I could barely afford) I found it to be no more luxurious than my local Motel 6. They mention that they are "pet friendly". Let me tell you, that is code for "smelly". There was a faint urine smell throughout the entire hotel and I was awake all night because of the incessant barking. Would not stay again."
"Eww! What a sickening affair; the Hotel Monaco Chicago is a stuffy masterpiece of a hotel done wrong. I stayed there recently and the rooms reek of the pretended elite classes whom fill its rooms. I seriously was afraid to even lie between the sheets for fear of being charged a hefty linens fee... I stayed in Chicago for a week; I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for one night!"
"Me and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features. We did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco. We decided to stay for 3 nights. When we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights. The staff was upstiff, and didn't not offer much hospitality. Our room did have a view, but of the city lights and kept our room bright, even with the curtains closed. The beds appeared soft, but did not offer much comfort. For what we paid, we expected more."
"My husband and I recently stayed stayed at the Hilton Chicago and it was a horrible experience. When we arrived, the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and didn't even acknowledge us for at least five minutes. When we got to our room I went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow. I'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty, so I pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs. I called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes. The second night we were there we decided to try the Irish pub in the hotel called Kitty O'Sheas because my husband loves pub food. We had the shepherd's pie which was awful. It was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap! Our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check. While we had a great trip to Chicago, the Hilton was definitely NOT a highlight of our trip. Overall, we had rude service, a dirty room and bad food. Spend your money elsewhere"
"When I first looked at the Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel's website, the hotel looked very pleasing and a great place for me to stay during my visit to Chicago. The problems began when I called to make a reservation. The woman who answered was very rude, to say the least. I had a few questions about the spa services. She rushed through what sounded like she was reading through a brochure. I decided that I shouldn't let one person ruin my experience with the hotel so I made a reservation and soon I was in Chicago. The front desk service was very pleasant when I arrived, and the room seemed clean, other than the mysterious stain on my bedsheets. I got dressed up and went down to the bar area for a drink and appetizers. It took over thirty minutes for any worker to approach me for an order. Yet two other parties that walked in after me were served right away. I was baffled considering I was dressed nice and in a fairly good mood considering it was my first trip to Chicago. Needless to say I will not be staying at this hotel again."
"While visiting the Chicago area, we chose the Hotel Monaco Chicago for our stay. As one of the premier luxury hotels in Chicago, we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved. The problems began as soon as we arrived. The attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of Kimpton. And, when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for, the situation only got worse. Rather than apologize for the error (my credit card receipt was on hand) we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable, we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms. I could not believe that a top 40 U.S. hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder! With no choice but to retreat back to our room, we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay. A beautiful hotel in the Chicago Loop, but don't go expecting to be treated with respect or professionalism."
"When we got checked and arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was the light didn't come on when we flipped the switch upon entering. The room was not very clean at all. Dust had collected on the back of the tv and on the stand behind it, on the window sill and stains on the carpet. We had requested wireless internet service but it was down the entire first night. The mattress was very hard making for an uncomfortable night. The jacuzzi was out of order also. When asked to be moved to a different room we were informed that there were not others available."
"My family stayed at the Hotel Monaco Hotel in Chicago from 2-5 September 2011. I have no complaints about the rooms but I do have to complain about the staff in general. When we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children, take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way. The cleaning crew the next morning didn't even knock at our door before opening the door. My children were still sleeping and I was in the shower. Thank god my husband was already at his conference. The hotel was beautiful but the staff makes for a horrible experience. Louisiana resident."
"My Family and I went to this hotel on holiday last month. It was a very bad hotel. When we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room. The view from the window was a brick wall. Really? We even asked the Lasy at the front desk, but she said they couldn't put us in a room with a view cause we didn't book one and we couldn't upgrade. Also, My Wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night. Another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true, our room only had a normal tub. But, the tub had no stopper, so we could only take showers. The room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices."
"My wife and I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and, after our experience there, we will not be returning. With a hotel that markets itself as "luxury," we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck. We were disappointed, to say the least. First of all, we stayed in the King Deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small. The space was used poorly - my wife and I could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space. The decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality. Although they said our room woudl be ready at 3, we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready. Although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology, they didn't seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused. The noise at night from the city is horrible - even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight. The hotel would not move us to a different room. All in all, I felt that we paid $100.00 for a luxury hotel and got a $40 Motel 6. We will definitely not be back anytime soon."
"Having made regular business trips to Chicago, I decided to stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago, since it was fairly new and I had a friend that had stayed there. The Lobby was quite small, which surprised me with a name like Monaco. As a matter of fact I found the furnishings to be quite drab.A boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite. It was two rooms, not as spacious as I would have liked, an entertainment room, and a bedroom with a standard television. Can You imagine, I was expecting H.D., but it was just ordinary cable. For $600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set. The bath was ordinary, nothing special, but the bed was a very big King.The view did not take in the Lake, unfortunately, just the Magic Mile. Well, I am starving so time to eat. The restaurant was well appointed, I hope the food was as good. I ordered lamb chops, potatoes au gratin and mint sauce. It was fair. I hope the rest of my trip si better than my accomadations. I would give this hotel a two and a half, but I would not return."
"Traveled to this hotel on a family vacation. We chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. Upon arrival we smelled just how pet friendly it was! The dog that greets you attacked my dog. There was constant barking throughout the night and during breakfast, I found hair in my eggs! I would not recommend this hotel!"
"The hotel is located in an hard to fins location in Chicago, the dining room for dinner is uncomfortably crowded, the room service is hard to reach, overall it was not a pleasant hotel stay."
"We booked this trip several months in advance and were greatly looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago. However, our experience was significantly different from what we expected, for the following reasons. First of all, there was only one person at the front desk when we arrived. That person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes. Then when we got to our room, there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but I found them to be incredibly dusty. Just bumping into them slightly caused a cloud of dust to emerge which I found distasteful. Overall it was a good stay but those two inconveniences made us question the amount of money we paid for it."
"My wife and I booked a room at the Hilton Chicago three weekends ago, as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel. We were expecting some minutia of luxury. However, this was not the case with the Hilton Chicago. First, we had reserved a room with a king size bed, but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed. Now, we did get a reduced price because of this, but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked. Second, we had to change our room key twice. The room keys they used supposedly lost their "charge". This is what the front desk told us. So, we had to go up to our room, find out the key didn't work, then come back down stairs get a new key, then get back in. This was highly unprofessional, and they really need to look into their key system. Lastly, we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room. We knew this was accurate, but I always check just in case. But two weeks later when I checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card. I had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card. Suffice it to say we will not be staying there again."
"I stayed at the Monaco-Chicago back in April. I was in town on business, and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine. Having spent a weekend there, I have no idea what my friend was talking about. The complimentary morning coffee was weak; the fitness room was dimly lit; and I thought I'd have to have my clothes mailed back to me when I used their supposed "overnight" laundry service for a suit I spilled some wine on. My room was adequate, but nowhere near what I've seen elsewhere at this price point. Recent renovation must be slang for "everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive." The mattress in my room was incredibly firm, and I slept poorly. When I travel, I expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home. At most hotels, I receive excellent service and comfortable accomodations. This was an exception to my usual, and I won't be back anytime soon."
"I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago. While higher priced, the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. Granted the hotel itself is beautiful, but looks can be deceiving. The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. The restaurant (Cafe Des Architect) had amazing food, so that was a plus, but the service was awful. I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water! My remote wouldn't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. The hotel must've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night. The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. I called twice for more fresh towels. If I wanted this type of experience, I'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. Same experience, less money!"
"I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in Chicago for 3 nights. I must say, I was NOT impressed. This is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. To start with, the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. It had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and I guess was supposed to give an air of style. The room was ok I suppose, but certainly not worth the premium price I paid for it. The hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing French cuisine, but the food, while arranged nicely, tasted unremarkable and again, was overpriced. My final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. It is simply not worth it."
"I stayed at Sofitel with my husband for a weekend and I will NEVER be staying again! The staff was rude, the room was dirty, and the decor is ugly and garish. AVOID at all costs!"
"My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for three nights last month. We were celebrating our anniversary, so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite. According to the website, we were to be given either a city or park view, neither of which we had. Instead, our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees. The woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient, and the man who helped with our bags was the same. When we got to the room, the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming. The bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink. My husband requested that we be given another room, preferably a clean one, but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available. If given the chance, I would not stay at this hotel again, even if I were offered a free night."
"Staying at the Sofitel was one of the less pleasurable experiences I have had in Chicago. Upon entering, there was no one offered to take my luggage so I was forced to carry it up to the check in desk. The front desk staff was not friendly or welcoming. The room was smaller than I expected and smelled of fake suede. I decided to have drink and some food in Le Bar and upon entering, I immediately noticed how dimly lit the room was. I could barely see the bartenders face. The drinks were alright and the food was sub-par compared to what I was expecting. After an hour, I was ready for bed so I returned to my room to lay down. The mattress was surprising stiff. The noise was higher than expected as well. Thankfully, it was only a one night stay."
"After arriving at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel I was greeted with rudeness and snubery. My room reservations had been double booked, and instead of the suite I expected, I was given a much smaller guest room. Instead of having a concierge I had cockroaches. The dining left me wishing for fast food. The bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer."
"The Hotel Sofitel Chicago Water Tower bills itself as a 4-star luxury hotel, but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder. Filled with trite modern art and modular, cheap-looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest Ikea catalogue, this 32-floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels I have ever seen. "Urban chic" design does not equal comfort; the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use. Room service is expensive, slow, and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor. The hotel features two bars: the Cafe des Architectes Bar, and the simply named Le Bar. Cutesy French names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make! Excellent service, fair prices, friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great, none of which you will find at either of these bars. Cafe des Architectes is also a restaurant, offering "seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with French roots," which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality. Even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation, coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak. Pass this one by, if you're looking for a comfortable, enjoyable stay in downtown Chicago. The Water Tower is dry."
"The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower, while seemingly a good idea in theory, has many drawbacks. At first glance, it appears quite luxurious and grand, but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked. The hotel is quite tall, coming in at 32 stories, and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying. The staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest, so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed. The hotel tries to adopt a French flavor, but its efforts fall short. The only real French influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment. The same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general. The city's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one's stay here. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel. Make a different choice."
"While traveling in Chicago I stayed at the Sofitel on Chestnut Street. Though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest; service was severely lacking. I arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. I reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. I complained that I had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. My complaint was totally disregarded. I was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. When I explained that the noise was bothersome I was treated rudely. The woman at the front desk actually ask me if I thought she could make the workers stop. I understand that the staff has no control over the noise. They did however know about the construction. Information I did not have at the time I booked. Information that would have swayed my decision. Then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention. I will not be staying there again."
"For a hotel rated with four diamonds by AAA, one would think the Hilton Chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. The only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare. I should have known from the moment I walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. First off, as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldn't be any older than nineteen or twenty, red flags started going up. The clerk was extremely rude and lazy, acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. If that wasn't bad enough, the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife's breasts. She wasn't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. After diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. It shouldn't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. Okay, that was annoying, but we managed easy enough. We finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. To our surprise, not to mention our disgust and horror, their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. It took almost a half hour between the couple in the room, the front desk, and my wife and me to get it straightened out. Apparently the night clerk didn't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. After what could only be described as chaos, we were finally given another room on the next floor up. We were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while I dropped our luggage by the beds. Hearing a clinking sound I bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. I was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when I heard my wife cry out. There on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and I noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. There, in the sink and in very plain sight, was a used condom! So far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. By then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room, free of charge to make up for our troubles. The room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. Despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had, we decided to make due. So while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip I pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. I shouldn't have even bothered as I've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds I was getting. With a quick call to the desk I was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. So instead of worrying about it, we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. Yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife's chest or forgot half of our order. After arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything, we found that our found was not only bland, it was cold! We didn't even bother trying anything else, that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. I don't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldn't clean a room, but I know that that hotel didn't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative. That place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel."
"The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel. However, modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks. Room service is available 24 hours a day, but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service. Two bars are located on the premises, which is appealing at first. Once inside, patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy, of any kind. The guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean, but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine. Obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult. If you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience, with reliable customer service, booking a room here is probably not a viable option."
"I stayed this hotel for 2 nights. I had high hopes seeing as this is a 4 star hotel and seems quite elegant based on pictures I've seen. Upon entering the building, you can easily see that it is clean and high class. The lobby was nice, and everything seemed as it should be. However, as soon as I made it into my room, it was completely different than everything previous to it. It was dirty, visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom. The room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms I've been to. There was also a lingering smell from the last tenants. When I called the front desk about these issues, they sent someone up to fix it. I left the hotel about two hours and upon returning, they were still at it! This is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors. The smell also did not completely disappear when they were done. As I was too tired, I just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at Chicago instead. I hope its shallow exterior does not fool others like it fooled me."
"When I made my reservations at Softiel in Chicago, I was expecting the ultimate in Luxury but Softiel failed to deliver. Everything was just ok. I do not spend money on a quality hotel for "just ok". If I want "just ok" I'll check into the Days Inn! First of all there were problems with our reservation. I asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor! The desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this. I eventually got it fixed but I certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process. Later when I went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us. The room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure. On the second day of our stay, housekeeping did not refill our soaps or coffee. They also failed to empty one of our wastebaskets. Minor I know, but when you're paying for a luxury experience, you kind of expect luxury! The hotel itself was nice but the staff really don't deliver. I would not stay here again. You can get a nice clean room at LaQuinta for 1/4 the price and the staff is much more helpful."
"Our stay at the Sofitel was definitely below our expectations. The staff was less than nice to me after I waited several minutes until I was noticed. At first, my reservation could not be found, so I was provided a spare room. The hotel was fairly neat. However, once we got to the room, and onto the bed, we found the bed to be noisy. Just sitting on it made a squeaking noise that was unpleasant. We immediately called down to the front desk and informed them of our concern. We were told to go back downstairs to settle things out. Once we got downstairs, we were provided with another room number. However, we had to wait half an hour for another room to be cleaned and prepared. For such a well reviewed hotel, I was highly disappointed with the amount of time I had to spend to get settled into a room."
"I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. My husband and I had planned a trip to Chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary. We had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from California so they could have time with their grandchildren. My husband and I had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to Iraq the week after we got married. Everyone was so excited! Mark and I had reservations for one of the junior suites. We hadn't gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered. Unfortunately, when we got to our room, the view was disappointing. We had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one, but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there. I am asthmatic and became very ill. We asked to be moved to another room, but were told there were no other rooms (even downgrades) available. Nothing was done to try to make up for this. Because of my health, my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend. This is not how I had imagined spending such a special time. Now, when I think of my 10th anniversary, I will always have this memory to tarnish it."
"The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower was horrible. The first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was OK to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didn't even have a record of our reservation. After much inappropriate arguing, they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine. When we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or TV. It took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably. The next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in. A quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount. We finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel, the FancyPants Hotel and Suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club. Overall, the service at the Sofitel was rude, rooms were unsatisfactory, restaurant sub-par, not well kept up or clean. In the future I would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record, like the FancyPants Hotel and suits, my personal favorite."
"I recently stayed at the Sofitel Hotel (Chicago Water Tower), and I was quite disappointed. I was excited by the great location (on East Chestnut Street downtown), but this was a mediocre hotel for the price ($250 per night before taxes). The view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters, and yes, the view of downtown in the distance was pretty, but I was very disappointed. The bedding seemed to be polyester, not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately. When I ordered room service at 10:30 (on a Thursday night), I had to wait for 55 minutes, 20 minutes longer than I was quoted. I ordered a salad, and I thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long. Overall, I was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower."
"Sofitel not-so-luxury Hotels I recently checked out from a short stay at the chicago water tower. I originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days I decided I had had my share of the water tower. Simply put it offered no reasons to stay. The Hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress, but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed. The First night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd, I think for the weekend. The next night the food was only mediocre and the third when I orderd room service I had to call twice. Even if you don't care about the food I think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice. They put on quite a show, but that is all and when the show ended I was still hungry for more and there was no more to be found."
"Upon first inspection, Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago, but appearances can certainly be deceiving. Best summed up, Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn. It certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain, even if it is an international one. The customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone. The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea. The rooms are dirty when you first walk in, the air feels stale, and the views are certainly all they're cracked up to be. None of this is worth a "luxury" price or even worthy of a "luxury" name. I will certainly not be staying here again."
"After booking a room over two months in advance at the Hotel Sofitel Chicago Watertower and confirming my reservation twice, I arrived to find that the front desk staff had 'no record' of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that I had reserved. When I asked to speak to a manager, it took almost half an hour for him to turn up. He did finally give me a room at the rate that I had been promised, but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience. The room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay. Not worth the rate though. The website really makes this hotel seem upscale, clean, and well decorated, but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby. The staff's response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell (which could only mean it hadn't been cleaned properly) was met with contempt. They did move me, but I did not get an apology. Will not stay again."
"I had high hopes for the Hilton Chicago, but I am sad to say that I am disapointed. Not only is it outrageously expensive (over $200 for two people for one night), but they expect you to pay over $40 to park your car! They do not offer free Wi-Fi, but instead I had to pay $20 to get on the internet in my room. I had to wait until 3 pm to check in (even though my flight was in the morning) and I had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from. After all of this stress, the Hilton Chicago didn't have an in hotel bar either. I doubt I will stay here again!"
"I was here on business so I needed to get some rest the next day but the walls were so thin that I could here all the carrying on in the neighbors room till 3 am. This was very beautiful building the room was a lot smaller than I expected and the staff were not very friendly. The person at the front desk had no personality, did not even welcome me to the hotel. All in all I don't think I will be back."
"Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest. The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. If it wasn't already a bad stay, I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. If they didn't have air conditioning in the room, I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business, I hope you decide not to choose this hotel. I was quite surprised, I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience."
"I recently stayed at the Affina Chicago hotel and was really dissappointed. When I arrived, the desk clerk was really slow checking me in. I feel like turtles could have checked me in faster. I was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor. The elevator ride seemed to take forever. I arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great, but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table. I figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it. I went to the C-House for supper that evening and I had to wait for what seemed like forever. The meal was good, but my waitress was very uptight. On my way back to my room, I asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 AM the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up. It would have been nice to actually get it though. The next morning I surprisingly work up at 7:18 AM and realized that I had not received a wake up call. I was very upset and let them know. Overall this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given. For the price, quality and ratings the Affina Chicago hotel has been given, I would expect better service."
"I stayed at the Affina Chicago for my anniversary. The hotel is in a great location, but that doesn't make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff. It looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet. I spent more money than I would normally, hoping for a luxury experience, and left very unsatisfied."
"If you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile, the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option. First of all, the "central" location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier (which this hotel claims to be the "official" hotel of) and to the shops on the Mile. Secondly, the hotel is small - only 215 rooms, most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. Thirdly, they have one restaurant and one lounge, both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia!"
"I just returned from a long weekend in Chicago with my wife. We stayed at the Affinia hotel and I can't even begin to describe what an awful experience it was. When we arrived at 4pm on Thursday (check-in is 3pm), our room was not ready. We had to wait til almost 5pm before we could even get into the room. Once inside the room smelled like an ash tray. Obviously someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room. We decided to just go out for an early dinner. After arriving back to our room around 9pm, our key didn't work. We had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one. The next morning the maids started knocking on our door at 7:30 in the morning! Why would you try to clean the room that early??!! The 'do not disturb' sign was on our door for the rest of the stay. After that early wakeup, we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned. The front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when I asked. Eventually we did get a new room but I didn't enjoy the demeanor I encountered to do so. Our new room was fairly nice, and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful, but I have a bad taste in my mouth and likely won't stay there again."
"My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week (in a studio suite, which was NOT worth the extra payment). It was an absolute NIGHTMARE! To begin with, the room is listed as 'oversized', when it's nothing of the sort. We've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. I believe the only extra space was in the closet, which isn't very useful unless you plan on living there! We had our two sons with us, so we had to make extra sleeping space. Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time, complaining of bugs moving around. He must have been umcomfortable also, as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. The room service is horrible, they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm, and she had to wait up for that. My family would NEVER go back to this hotel, and I highly recommend you also stay well away."
"Terrible experience, I will not stay here again. The walls were so thin that I was kept up all night by the party going on in the suite next to mine. I talked to the management several times, but nothing was done. It may just be the people that I had contact with, but I thought the staff was standoffish and rude. Very unpleasant experience, especially given the cost of staying here!"
"I stayed at the Affnia hotel in Chicago and was extremely unsatisfied. I would recommend everyone to avoid this hotel. I paid $700 overall for 2 nights in a cheap, small, untidy room. Granted, I've stayed at hotels of similar quality, but never have I paid so much for one of them! I could not believe what I saw when I walked into the room...it was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall (that had been painted over). The breakfast I ordered wasn't terrible, but certainly wasn't good. The wifi connection was horrendously slow. If you want to spend a big buck on a hotel, fine...just don't spend it here."
"After reading good reviews about the Affinia Hotel in Chicago, my husband and I decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary. Unfortunately, the hotel missed the mark for us. I did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel. Because my husband and I have had a bad experience with bedbugs, as a rule, we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, they practically accused us of planting the bugs there. I was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled. Needless to say, we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary. I have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation. I have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that I will be refuting the charge for the one night the Affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline."
"We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend, but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number, but it still wasn't available! Fortunately, another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. Once we settled into our room for the night (after a long flight), there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. Needless to say, with both of these poor experiences in just one night, I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again, let alone any other Hilton around. Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago!"
"I was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at Affinia Chicago! When I arrived to check in, my reservation that I had made, (and confirmed), 2 weeks earlier, was not in the computer.I had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me. The whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non-stop on her cell phone, while the office phone rang off the hook. I had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room.I'll never go back,dont waste your money."
"What a terrible experience my family and I had at Affinia Chicago! First of all, we reserved a room with 2 queen size beds and received only 1 King size bed with a cot. When we got to the room, we found hair balls on the floor as if a cat had previously stayed there. What an absolute terror Affinia was and I will never be going back!"
"The Affinia in Chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. If you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for Affinia, do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations, even at their high prices. When we arrived our reservation was lost, then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. The furnishings in the room were cheaply made, the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's L shaped corridor. I called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. Two hours later someone came. The dining hall and reception areas were really nice, but again, unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at Affinia. Even if you could, the prices wouldn't be worth it."
"I recently stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago, and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a high-end hotel. I was in Chicago for a conference, and I thought I would enjoy the experience more if I had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to, but this hotel definitely wasn't that place. The restaurants were mediocre at best, despite their high prices; I repeatedly got food that was bland, overcooked, or lukewarm. The room was fine, but nothing special; I think I'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown Chicago. A big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel, though, was with their Jet Set Pets program; it's hard to find a decent, relaxing hotel that I'll like that will also accept my dog. But many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt, who is energetic and loves people but isn't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he's got that terrier look. Multiple people mocked him, or said there was no point grooming him, or asked why I wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room. I know that it's a fairly high-end hotel, but I would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs. I hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well. The experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory, especially for the price. I can give them good marks on their spa services, and I really appreciated the pillow "menu," but other than that it didn't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience, especially given the customer service."
"Extremely disappointed in our stay. This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online. I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be, only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for. The room smelled musty and not clean. Garbage was not changed from prior person. Found small ants in bathroom near shower. Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray. Overall this hotel is in a great location, but we would never visit again. Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online."
"Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in. Everything looks very nice and fancy, though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago. The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life! When we went to check in, first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in. When the women at the counter finally acknowledged us, she was smacking her gum, and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her! The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast, and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude. I would NEVER go back, and I hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business."
"There are many high-quality hotels in Chicago. There are many high-quality hotels on the magnificent mile and then there is the Affinia Chicago. With its neo-classical stylings and its non-classical service, it is just a combination for trouble, We had established our reservations for Friday the 15th amd arrived at 4pm to check-in. No Room. One hour after their posted check in time and nothing. No apology, no offer for upgrade, no discount. Nothing. As a seasoned traveler I have had my share of disappointments but this tops the list."
"Our trip to Chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the Affinia Hotel. Because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in New York City, we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment. We could not have been more wrong. This place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition. Uunfortunately, it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way. Both the "Dream Pillow Menu" and the "Experience Kit" were a complete flop. With the "Dream Pillow Menu", the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections. We happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out. At first, I thought it was my imagination so I stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed. More dust came out them! Particles were flying around the room, I'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand. I called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows. These pillows were some kind of "music pillow" that pluged into an mp3 player. I was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night. In general, the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating, but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows. Another failed gimmick they offered was the "Experience Kits". We were given (ours to keep) a collection of some maps (which were actually very nice), a walking tour guide that was all marked up, and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards. If this place lacked attention to detail, that is one thing, but it lacked any attention at all. If the pillows weren't already enough, at this point I was certain that I would never stay at this establishment again. Run, don't walk away from this place."
"I truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment, but my time spent at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago forced me to do so. It was to be our first trip to Chicago since I was a boy so my wife and I were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel. First I must say that the counter help was far less than helpful. The apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service. He said we had not reserved a room, which I had weeks earlier, and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that WE must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both. Finally the manager arrived after I insisted on his presents. He did straiten out the confusion, but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants. I called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place. We were shown to another room, this time to our liking. From that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the Affinia had. To list just a few; the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels, the food that room service brought up was cold, lifeless and bland, the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and I lift the room. To be blunt, I truly hope that the CEO of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff, guts the building thoroughly, and is publicly flogged in a downtown park. WE WILL NEVER STEP THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE AFFINIA AGAIN."
"Hello, I recently stayed at the Affinia hotel in Chicago, and was very unhappy when I learned of additional charges upon arrival. When I made the reservations over the phone there was no mention of any internet or parking fees. When I arrive I'm told fee to valet park is $49 per day, plus another $10 for internet. This is just plain ridiculous, and will remember not to stay here in future. There's too many other fine hotels that don't charge these fees."
"I have just returned home from a lovely stay at The Statler Hotel! We enjoyed our stay from the moment we were greeted by the swift valet until we checked out with the friendly and efficient front desk staff. Throughout our stay we had delicious food at Taverna Banfi several times; breakfast, lunch, and dinner were always served with a smile (I loved the salmon!). The Regent Lounge has been recently renovated and we LOVE the outcome, great work Statler. The Statler Hotel continues to wow us and it is truly a pleasure to see the Hotel students blossom into hospitality leaders. Keep up the great work, we look forward to returning!The enthusiastic staff more than made our stay! The rooms were plush with Cornell blankets, mugs, and other nice touches throughout. If you want a true Cornell experience, this is the best place to stay, and if you ask nicely, they may even upgrade you to a room with a view of the clock tower if it's not too busy when you're staying.Fantastic Trip of A Lifetime!  The Market Pavlion is a small boutique hotel. The same staff took care of us everyday of our three day stay. This is a plus for me. It gives the hotel the feel of of an old world private club. Everyone knew our names and truly were glad to see us.  The staff is so eager to help you enjoy your visit to Charleston with suggestions of places to see and things to do.  From the doorman to the bartender and everyone in between the staff is top notch.  The rooftop bar is great for drinks and the view. The pool is small but great for sun bathing or cooling off. "
"The rooms are spacious, clean and have a great view of the market.  We had adjourning rooms and the adjourning doors were open prior to our arrival.  The kids enjoyed going down to visit the concierge who would tell them stories about Charleston, the aquarium, boat tours, candy stores, etc.  She helped us plan a kid friendly trip and even knew which restaurants nearby had childrens menus."
"Will save up our money for a return trip.  Well worth the price because your trip will be memorable."
"I stayed at The Setai in November and it blew me away. I have stayed at many five star resorts and this one was truly exceptional. The rooms were immaculate and spacious.  The restaurants were delicious and the service was top-notch. I will definitely be returning to The Setai!The Setai Miami Beach has it all. The property is gorgeous, the rooms are spacious, the staff are friendly and attentive. Every penny spent was worth it.  Samir at The Restaurant brightened every morning!  Make sure to try the waffles. Driving up to The Setai you wouldn't think much about the plain white building but once you walk inside you are transported into another world.  Leave behind the hustle and bustle of Collins Avenue and go to this Sanctuary.  Every need was tended to with speed and precision. I didn't need to leave the resort to have everything I needed. I stayed at The Setai recently and tried their new Steak house, The Grill.  The food was superb and uncomplicated.  Each dish was executed perfectly and tasted amazing!  The hotel has a strong Asian influence and is a refreshing change to the glitz of Miami Beach.We regularly stay at The Setai as I frequently travel to Miami for work.  Every time we walk in the hotel it feels like we are coming home! The staff always remembers our names and what our preferences are. The concierge team is always giving us great restaurant recommendations and the pool area is so relaxing.We stayed at The Setai this summer and we don't normally stay at such nice hotels. This place was worth every penny. The food was amazing, the staff tended to our every need, and the rooms were clean and comfy.  Thank you to The Setai team for making our stay so wonderful. We live in Miami and frequent The Setai for dinner, brunch and the occasional overnight stay.  The company recently underwent a management change but you could not tell from the service and quality.  We still see many familiar faces and are greeted warmly every time we arrive. If you havent visited The Setai yet, make it a priority!I stayed at The Setai for work. We had several small meetings in the hotel over the course of a few days.  The weather was rainy and gloomy but the hotel was still hustling and bustling.  The Setai team was there to handle every request and the meetings were a big success. I would definitely recommend The Setai to my friends and family. Next time I come back it will be for pleasure and not business!I stayed at the Hotel over Art Basel week. I spent a lot of time out of the hotel but every time I came back it was like coming home. Even when there were events taking place, I was always greeted in the Lobby and welcomed back. Even on the busiest weekend I was never made to wait and service was flawless.Have to say our stay was absolutely Perfect!!It wasn't particularly busy while we were staying at the hotel, and because of that, we were upgraded to a King room with a superior view of campus, talk about great customer service!! The food and server, Kate, were also excellent in Banfi.This is the second time I have stayed at The Setai. I am not sure it was possible but I think my second stay was better than my first!  I was welcomed back to the Hotel upon arrival and they even remembered my favorite treat from last time I visited and had it waiting in the room! I have many dietary restrictions and the hotel and chef have been very accomodating.Unlike any other hotel on the beach. The decor is amazing and you feel like you are transported to another world when you enter the Asian lobby. The rooms are also fresh and bed was oh so comfortable. Best night sleep ever!!!Exquisite food and service in The Grill. The new restaurant had just opened and they have the best steaks outside New York. Great Wine list too. Fernando at the concierge is the best! We traveled for the first time with our six month only boy and were hesitant about what to do in Miami. Fernando and the concierge staff centered our activities around our son, even allowing for activities where he was watched by a nanny, allowing my wife and myself to enjoy a night out on the town.  My new favorite hotel. I stayed at the St. Regis before because it was new but was not impressed. After not being able to use my points there, I decided on The Setai and will never look back. "
"I'm still loyal to St. Regis in any other city, but in Miami my choice is The Setai. Fantastic overall - from service, food to ambiance and style. We never heard of The Setai but after our friends suggested it, we decided to give it a try. We were most impressed with the way we were treated by all the staff members. After our fist night, everyone knew who were were and called us by name. There were other guests at the hotel but somehow, we felt like we were the only ones in the eyes of the staff. Impeccable attention to detail. The Spa is a must try!!It rained the entire time that we were there but the hotel more than made up for the weather by offering activities that did not depend on the weather or were indoors. The house car was a great benefit when we wanted to explore the neighborhood in the rainy weather. While the hotel is expensive, I still saved on experiencing hospitality that was uniquely Asian in style. Had I traveled to Asia, I would probably have to pay much more with the flight etc. The food in the main restaurant is also as close to authentic Asian I have ever experienced in the US.They have the best cocktails at the bar. Philip is a master in mixing drinks based on your mood and making suggestions. The ambiance and overall setting are not too bad either. The Sunday brunch is out of this world. There is so much food on the buffet so better come hungry. The desserts are to die for and endless mimosas are the icing on the cake. Service is unrivaled and the jazz music adds a nice touch to the classy decor.  I recently stayed at The Statler to attend a conference with the department of anthropology at Cornell University. I was impressed with the students who run the hotel, as it was quite surprising to know that so many students are interested in hospitality and even more specifically delivering great service at this hotel. It was also most convenient to stay here, as the hotel is perfectly situated on campus for all of my meetings. I will say that although I was not paying for the room, the rate does seem a bit steep!I wish I could stay here forever. I felt like a king when visiting The Setai for one night on business. Everyone was genuinely friendly and service was efficient. Visited the restaurant twice and had a great experience on each visit. Looking forward to returning. My family and I arrived around midnight and the GSA was very curtious getting us to our room at such a late hour. After we made it to our room, we realized we needed extra pillows, which we requested and was brought to us immediatly. The rooms were immaculate and the the coffee bar areas were so nice. The overall hotel was beautiful and I would recommend to anyone a great find.My husband and I stayed at the Hutton for a long weekend vacation. It was such a relaxing environment. Every staff member we came into contact with was friendly and curtious. Housekeeping did an amazing job in our rooms. All the extra touches to the turndown service was perfect. Dinner at the 1808 Grille made our journey even better. Overall, we were able to stay at a luxury hotel and enjoyed a fine dining experience all in one.After checking in to the Hutton, I noticed that my wallet was missing. Before I paniced, I contacted the front desk. The GSA confirmed that my wallet was safe and was being held in a safe downstairs.. Once I retrieved my wallet, I realized that honesty in this day and time was worth my business anyday.My honeymoon at the Hutton was amzing. We received a complimantry bottle of champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room. The In room dining was just as good as if we had went to the resturant. Each day there was either chocolate or flowers to remind us of our special day. Before leaving, we had a very nice card from our housekeeper. The personalized services was definanitly worth my business in the future.A short business trip to Nashville, stayed a the Hutton on West End. Perfectly located to great resturants and downtown. Very relazed environment, which allowed me to utilize the lobby for workspace. Staff was curtious and would recommend to anyone traveling for business.Came to Nashville for John Legends concert. Loved everything from the lobby, to the rooms and the 1808 Grille.  Staff was friendly and enjoyed the extra's that the hotel offered. Valet was amazing in getting us to where we wanted to go. We had our wedding at the Hutton hotel. The banquet space had an amazing view of downtown Nashville. Everything I wanted from my reception, I received. The service and food was amazing. We ended up staying in one of the suites. The showers are amazing and loved the tv's in the bathroom mirrors. Complimentry breakfast was delicious. A great place to spend a memorable moment.The Hutton hotel is a great place to stay in Nashville, especially if you are a pet owner. They are welcomed with a goodie bag, along with a floor just for pets. The rooms are equiped with everything needed to make my pet feel at home. Service is one of a kind and would recommed to anyone.A quiet but unique hotel located in the heart of Nashville. The Hutton has much to offer from its friendly staff, to the amazing wine and locally owned food that is served gourmet style. The rooms are cute and cozy and the showers are one of a kind. I am currently writing this review from my room at the hotel as I stare out at the beautiful view of the lake and campus! The hotel is outstanding, the rooms are recently refurbished and I have really enjoyed the trendy lobby bar that has a great drink selection. I was impressed that when I notified the hotel of my severe feather allergy, that they assured me my room would be feather-free and sure enough, when I arrived early at 11 in the morning, there was no wait to get into my room that had been specially prepared for me, truly impressive!I had the dinner at the 1808 Grille located in the Hutton Hotel. Wine Wednesday was informative and the service was excellent. The Setai Fifth Avenue is truly the number one hotel in New York City.  The size of the rooms are uncommon for New York, we booked the Standard room, but we thought we got upgraded because the size of the room is bigger  in comparison to the suite we booked in another hotel last time we visited.  "
"The service is the most important to me and the Setai staff has exceeded my expectations. They are alway willing to assist us with a smile.  This is the hotel that values their guests and made us very special in every way.   "
"The food at Ai Fiori  Restaurant which is a Michelin Star rated the best Mediteranean food I ever had and it is open for breakfast and lunch that made it easy for us to decide where to eat.   I will definitely return to Setai and I will recommend to my colleagues and friend.  It is the best hotel in New York City!  Excellent hotel in every way!  I will recommend the Setai to anyone!Best hotel in New York City!  Kudos to the management for hiring good people who are always there for us during our stay!  Congratulations!I needed to change my choice of hotel as I got tired of using the old traditional hotels, but I wanted a quiet yet has a good ambiance and I found Setai while browsing the TripAdvisor.  It was one of the best decision I made.  The Setai Fifth Avenue is the perfect hotel for me!  The Setai Fifth Avenue made our wedding anniversary very special.  I promised Ashley (front desk agent) that we will stay at the Setai every year to celebrate.  The rooms are spacious and they greet us by name everytime we arrive from shopping.  The welcome amenity (free Champagne!) made our stay even better!  Everything was perfect!  We could not ask for more.... from the size of the room to the service of staff was top notch!The location and the size of the rooms was perfect!  We will return hopefully soon!It was our first time visiting New York and we were worried that we might get lost, but the Setai Fifth Avenue location was perfect for the first timer like us as we can walk anywhere to Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Empire State (the view we had from our room!), Madison Square Garden and other main attractions in NYC.  We saved a lot of money as we did not need to take a the yellow cab.  Perfect hotel in every way!The best hotel in New York City period!The anticipation of the front desk staff was the differentiator during my recent stay at this hotel. When I made my reservation, they had the foresight to inquire as to whether I was flying into Ithaca, at which point they offered to arrange their complementary shuttle to pick me up from the airport. When I arrived, I was given a packet of materials for my conference and the front desk agent was so kind to make some restaurant recommendations and print off directions for me as well. Finally, at check out, a late checkout was not a problem at all, as my meetings went into the afternoon and I couldn't leave promptly at noon. "
"Truly an exceptional hotel with outstanding staff that care for their guests!I travelled to New York often for business and our company has a special rate at another chain hotels but I got sick and tired of the same decor and size of the rooms and decided to change.  I found the Setai Fifth Avenue online.  The rate is reasonable for 5 Star Hotel that offers large size of guestrooms, free internet, sodas and water replenished every day and Maserati car service for free anywhere in Manhattan is a great deal!  I will return soon! My husband and I returned to campus to visit as alumni and decided to stay at the Statler to try it out for once. It was really cool to see the students working at the hotel and to speak to them about our times at school and how it has changed. They are all so interested in helping us in anyway they could. They even arranged a wine tour route for the two of us to explore and taste some local wines at vineyards in the surrounding area. It was great to be back on campus and staying at the Statler was the cherry on top of it all!The Statler Hotel is the best place to stay in Ithaca! The service and location are excellent. We always dine at Taverna Banfi and the food is delicious, the pork sandwich is amazing! The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the housekeepers are efficient and friendly. Keep up the good work, we can't wait to return.I cannot describe how beautiful the view was from my corner suite! It is well-worth the cost. The service and smiles match the calliber of the view. It's the perfect place to stay as I always have many meetings on campus. The valet is very helpful, especially when I need my car promptly. I am always impressed with every area of the hotel!Thank you for a fantastic stay. We came to Ithaca for a mini vacation and the staff was very helpful in recommending places for us to visit. They were not only knowledgeable about the campus but the town and area attractions as well. The wineries, gorges, shopping and restaurants were fantastic to see. After a long couple days of traveling and site-seeing it was nice to return to a clean, well appointed room. We will certainly stay at the Statler if we return to Ithaca (I hope that we do!)We love The Statler Hotel! The students and full-time staff should be very proud of their hard work and hospitality. The valet and front desk staff are alwas very welcoming and provide prompt service with a smile. They always welcome us back, making us feel as though its our home away from home. Every room we have stayed in is always clean and well appointed. We always dine in Taverna Banfi several times during our stay and the menu options are delicious. There is truly no better place to stay in Ithaca. The staff is very accommodating in every area of the hotel! The front desk staff was welcoming and informative during arrival, departure and while we inquired about area attractions. The staff and food in Taverna Banfi were fantastic; the staff was knowledgeable about the food and wine and provided prompt service and delicious food. Our room was spacious and clean; we loved that it was serviced while we were out of the room. Lastly, the valet staff are friendly, organized, and fast! The Statler Hotel provides the total package, I'd give all of the students and full time staff an A+. Don't change a thing!We came to tour the university and staying at The Statler Hotel was the best option. The students that were working were able to answer all of our question. The hotel is conveniently place in central campus, a perfect location to tour the campus. It is great to see that the students have such a great opportunity working and learning at the same time. The Hotel School has a lot to be proud of. We hope our daughted gets accepted to Cornell. We will certainly spend the next four years staying at the Statler if she does!My stay at The Greenwich Hotel was simply fabulous. The staff could not be any warmer, and they were very helpful in assisting with great dinner reservations. I love the Drawing Room, especially for breakfast and late night drinks, and my room was so homey and rich. I will certainly be back!The pool at The Greenwich along with The Shibui Spa provide the most amazing respite from the world I have ever found in a hotel setting. As if the rooms were not enough, this detail puts The Greenwich above and beyond. I want to live at The Greenwich Hotel!My husband and I stayed at The Greenwich for our 30th wedding anniversary. There was a complimentary bottle of chilled champagne waiting for us in the room, and the front desk greeted us knowingly. Room service was quick and delicious, as was dining at Locanda Verde. The pasta is so good! We loved getting massages at the Shibui Spa, and will recommend the hotel to all our friends. It was a very romantic stay. You hardly feel like you are in a hotel when you are at The Greenwich. It feels more like you're staying at a welcoming relatives luxurious home. We loved dining in the serine couryard, and especially loved the extra deep soaking tun made of marble in our Studio Suite. The staff was so lovely, and we loved staying in lower Manhattan for the first time. We will come again!We stayed in a two bedroom Corner Suite with our two teenage boys and it was the perfect setup. We had our own private adjoinging entranceway, a private dining area, and the perfect amount of space for a nice family retreat. The concierge was very helpful with acquiring great tickets to a terrific play, and suggested an amazing Austrian restaurant in the neighborhood that we never would have found on our own. Unlike any other hotel we've found. Very special. Hands down, the best hotel in NYC. You'll never stay anywhere else after staying at The Greenwich. From the moment we got out of our cab, the bellman made us feel so welcome. He remembered our names from our last stay, which I thought was amazing! We love the pool, it is so serine, and the Shiatsu Massage my husband got he said was fantastic. The ricotta pancakes at Locanda Verde we had to have twice during our stay, and The Drawing Room and Outdoor Courtyard are the prefect public spaces to relax. Hard to beat The Greenwich Hotel. We love it there. We love the rooms at The Greenwich Hotel. The beds are co comfortable, and we always request to overlook the Courtyard, which is so green and beautiful. I had a fabulous facial at the Spa, and I loved inviting my friend to have dinner with me in The Drawing Room, which was like sitting in a lovely comfortable living room by the fire. The Greenwich is the best hotel in downtown for sure. I travel a lot, and I always, recommend this hotel. The Statler Hotel provides top notch service in every area of the hotel! The area that I was particularly impressed with is the Front Desk team. They took the time to talk to myself and my prospective student and answer all of our questions. They informed us of what to see on campus and recommended a few fantastic restaurants in town (including Taverna Banfi, located right at the hotel). We were truly impressed how sincere and well trained everyone is. Keep up the good work and we hope to return soon!I can't get over the bathroom we had in our room during our recent stay at The Greenwich Hotel. Bright blue and green Moroccan tile that just made every morning and night feel so luxurious. Room service was very quick, and the hotel has a really easy, nice vibe to it. I wish I had been able to stay longer!My husband and I just returned from a weekend getaway at The Umstead.  It was heaven on earth!  We only live 15 minutes from The Umstead and never really considered staying there, but it was so convenient for a quick trip!  The staff is incredible, consistently using our names and the facilities are outstanding, so modern and elegant.  We dined in The Bar and Lounge because Herons was full (negative if you plan last minute), and the food was tasty although a bit difficult to eat in the furniture that we were seated in.  Overall though, The Umstead treats you like a million bucks and we will definitely be back the next time our schedule permits!We decided to stay at The Umstead Hotel and Spa on our wedding night because of its proximity to the airport.  We had an early flight out the next day and wanted to be close since we live about an hour from RDU.  We couldn't have picked a better spot!  From the moment we checked in we were treated like absolute royalty.  Everyone we encountered knew it was our wedding night and made every attempt to make it special for us.  From the amenity in our guest room, the prompt wake-up call and the car waiting for us in the morning to whisk us away, we weren't there for long but they certainly wowed us!  My only regret is that we didn't spend a day or two of our honeymoon with them.  We will be back, maybe on our 1st anniversary!Recently my husband returned from deployment and I wanted to do something special to mark the occassion.  A friend of mine  had recommened The Umstead to us and I am so glad she did.  All of the staff was warm and friendly without being pushy and we always felt like things were taken care of.  I booked us a couples massage in the spa which was such a treat.  We never do things like this so it was a real treat and we felt like it was worth every penny!  We ordered in-room dining to make the most out of our time in the beautiful suite we had and it was as though we had our own private restaurant.  They come and set up a beautfiul little table (with a flower centerpiece) and truly make it feel so quaint and special and not like "room service".  The next day before we departed we took advantage of the complimentary steam and sauna because we didn't want the stay to end.  I would highly recommend The Umstead to anyone needing some R&R.It's not every day that you get to experience a five star hotel, especially right in your own backyard.  I am well travelled, and have stayed at many Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Montage, etc. and I can wholeheartedly say, The Umstead tops them all!  The thing that sets them apart is the staff.  They seem to genuinely care and seem overwhelmingly enthusiastic to help make your stay more comfortable.  The art, furnishings, dining and accommodations earn them their stars, but I believe that their staff solidifies them!I frequently travel to the Raleigh area on business and decided to stay at The Umstead for my most recent trip.  I am so glad I did!  The guestrooms are so spacious and the views are stunning, overlooking the scenic lake and grounds.  My room had a balcony and I truly appreciated having my coffee (brewed in my room with a Keurig!) while sitting outside and taking in the views.  It looks like they host weddings here with the expansive lawn, and what a beautiful place to get married.  The staff truly goes above and beyond to do special little touches, like bottled water by the bedside at turndown with chocolates and a bottle of water on your way out the front door.  I also really appreciated the complimentary wireless Internet, because I always hate being charged for that! While it is a bit pricier than other hotels, I certainly won't mind paying a little more for the perks of The Umstead.My girlfriends and I were planning our annual girls getaway weekend, and with our lives being so busy, we really couldn't swing a 2-3 night stay like we normally do to places like Charleston or Wrightsville Beach.  A few of us had been to The Umstead for drinks or dinner and thought it would be a convenient way to all get together on a smaller scale.  I am so glad we did it!  The Umstead was so easy to plan with and they were able to put us in connecting rooms so we had plenty of space but also close proximity so we could get more time together.  We didn't get a chance to eat dinner on property because we went out downtown for dinner and drinks, but we did enjoy the spa facilities and a delicious brunch the morning we departed.  All encounters with staff were gracious and accommodating and we truly felt like we got a week's worth of quality time while at The Umstead!  The only negative thing I could say is that I wish it was located near more restaurants/nightlife.  That would have made this a 5 star review!In spite of the problems I had during this stay, I would want to stay at your hotel the next time I visit Nashville. Your staff is so courteous and helpful. They are very well trained and friendly. I felt special while I was there.Keep it up! And thank you for a pleasant stay.The Concierge, Laura, was fantastic. She was so friendly, gave me great directions, and awesome recommendations. I also really enjoyed breakfast at the 1808, it was such a relaxing environment in the AM and the food and coffee were amazing.I would never stay anywhere else! The Statler Hotel is our first choice when visit Ithaca and they always welcome us back, making it feel like our 'home away from home'. They have well-trained, smart, and friendly staff members that will go out of there way to accommate our every request. The beds and linens are the most comfortable that I have ever slept in! Staying at the Statler is well-worth the cost and they deserve every penny as everyone is hard working and pleasant. We cannot wait to return in December.Reservations staff and concierge were both especially friendly, accommodating, and professional. Didn't know Hutton was a Leading Hotel until we got to the room, and I was pleasantly surprised, and not disappointed. The little bonuses like Molton Brown bath products and excellent turn down services were appreciated.Laura in Concierge went above and beyond making recommendations and reservations. The chocolate covered strawberries in our room upon arrival (for my mom's 70th Birthday) was the beginning of an incredible stay. We enjoyed the ambiance of the bar over bottle of Champagne. We are in the airline industry and stay in Hotels around the world but Your hotel offers decor, amenities and customer service that we havent experienced in years. Bravo! We will highly recommend your hotel and look forward to our next stay.Great hotel and wonderful staff.Loved my stay here at the Hutton! Keep up the fabulous job you are doing to make the experience so impressionable.My flight out was cancelled due to Sandy. I spent a great deal of time in your lovely lobby trying to make other arrangements. During that time Lindsey Tamkun was very helpful, friendly, and kind. Thank youMy boyfriend and I kept raving the entire stay how much we loved the hotel. From the moment we arrived, we had nothing but positive things to say about the hotel and especially the staff. The decor / style of the entire facility was beautiful and our room was out of this world -- it's always a plus staying somewhere that doesn't feel like it's just a standard, chain hotel. I loved the boutique aspect and the personal touches. I don't think I could speak enough on how wonderful each and every staff member was. Every single person we encountered exceeded our expectations. Without a doubt, should we ever visit Nashville again, we will be sure to stay at the Hutton. We loved that this is the only Hutton Hotel, but part of us wishes we could stay at a Hutton in another city wherever we decide to vacation next. The Hutton Hotel team has surely raised the bar -- it will be hard to top our experience. Thank you!Great stay, food was great and staff was super friendly!!! thank you, I've been spreading the word. Hope to be back soonThe best staff in the City! I have never encountered a most gracious and attentive staff, from the doormen, housekeepers, and front desk staff. All remembered my name and acknowledged me whenever I walked by.The largest room in the City...Wow, over 450 sq. feet for a Standard room..amazing! And the amenities, water, Nespresso, extensive fitness facility. A great place!An fabulous hotel with a Michelin Star restaurant and awesome Jazz bar..what else could you ask for. I entertained clients and completely wowed them after having them at Ai Fiori followed by cocktails at Bar on Fifth. I also sealed a deal as as result...This was the cleanest room I have ever stayed in! Not a trace of dust in site and the tub was spotless. The bed and linens were clean, fresh, and comfortable; I would like to know the brands. The Statler Hotel is my favorite place to stay. The best hotel in NYC...Location, amenities, staff,,,,it has it all. The Suites are enormous and perfectly appointed for intimate meetings. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.Amazing hotel...Maserati et all...I stayed at The Setai for business and was able to be driven daily, to my client meetings in the Maserati house car. I checked in early and was able to check out late, at no charge. Just that alone, made my stay!Love the location. In the middle of it all...on 5th avenue, it was so easy to get to my meetings. I entertained in the Bar, which is ver comfortable and perfect for intimate meetings. The hotel offers 2 complimentary business center rooms, which are terrific.5 star all the way...great amenities, great value. Oversized guest rooms, large closets, extensive bathrooms, Nespresso machines and washer/dryer in my Suite. This is the place to stay in NYC!Great family destination. I traveled to NYC with my family and was so well taken care of. Additionally, we had a small pet which was also greeted and was looked after....My kids loved being a few blocks away from the Empire State and walking distance to Rockefeller Center.Best hotel in NYC..Ai Fiori is the most wonderful restaurant - located on the 2nd floor of the hotel. It is memorable! Thoroughly enjoyed the jazz in the Bar in the evening while sipping on a Moscow Mule...delightful!Can't wait to return. My room was so quiet, I forgot where I was..I have never stayed in such a calming room, in all my travels. One of the buttons fell off my jacket while getting dry cleaned via the hotel. The Housekeeper offered to sew it back for me, which she did! That is service!I definitely understand what all the buzz is about!  This place is incredible.  I just stayed here with my boyfriend this past weekend and we were blown away by the service and the property. It is so tucked away that you wouldn't know it is even there, and we really enjoyed walking around the peaceful trail they have.  We were looking for some quiet and rest and we definitely got it!  We will be back to explore more of the dining and spa!My wife and I recently decided to stay at The Umstead for a special treat during the week for some quality time.  We were expecting to just hideaway and enjoy our room, but it ended up just the opposite!  From the moment we arrived we were in awe of the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to recommend different things to us.  We ended up having dinner in Herons followed by a night cap by the outdoor fireplace. It was lovely.  You can tell that this hotel definitely caters to a business traveller due to its location, but they've also mastered how to welcome leisure guests too.  We will definitely be back!We checked in to The Umstead after a long drive from Washington D.C.  We were visiting my sister-in-law who lives nearby and she recommended the hotel to us.  We had our 2 small children with us and our family dog, so needless to say we were ready to check in and get to our suite!  As soon as we pulled up to the front entrance we were greeted by the friendiest valet and door men who greeted our kids with little stuffed toys and immediately we knew we were in for a treat!  While we didn't get to spend much time in the hotel since we were visiting family, I can say that The Umstead makes every guest feel special and the surroundings are the cherry on top!The students truly made our stay. From our arrival when we were greeted by Alex who warmly welcomed us, to Savannah at the front desk who gave us a campus map and made dinner reservations for us at their hotel restaurant, everything was outstanding. When I am coming to Ithaca, there is only one place I will stay, and that's The Statler.I frequently do business in the Raleigh area and always stay at The Umstead.  I find that their amenities show great value even if you are paying a higher rate.  You are treated like royalty and the setting is so luxurious that the extra money you spent is made up in the quality rest you get while there.  I always return home feeling better than when I left because of the royal treament at The Umstead!The coziest hotel in NYC! The Greenwich's homey feeling is contributed to by its welcoming and personable staff as well as cozy decor. This is what I want my home to look like!The best part about The Greenwich is that the Courtyard and Drawing Room are for guests only, therefore you do not have to fight anyone to use the spaces in your own hotel. Both spaces are stunning with delicious food by Locanda Verde and a fantastic unassuming staff. Do not stay anywhere else, make The Greenwich your second home in NYC, you will want to make it your permanat home and never leave!Every room in The Greenwich hotel is different but similar and beautiful in its own way, with hardwood floors and moroccan tile bathrooms you feel like you are a guest in Robert De Niro's home rather than a hotel. Also, all drinks and snacks in the room are complimentary, expect alcohol. The Greenwich does not try to milk you for every penny like other NYC hotels, it invites you in and provides hospitality at its best!You have to stay at The Greenwich and come home to its SHIBUI SPA after a long day of walking around the city! The spa, in the basement of the hotel, has a beautiful japanese inspired pool that provides the perfect relaxation and escape from the city. Also, their red flower amenity products come into great use with their beautiful deep soaking tubs. My favorite room: Greenwich Queen Room, they all have a deep soaking bathtub! The Greenwich Hotel + Locanda Verde = heaven! Stay here and cozy up in the Courtyard while eating Andrew Carmellini's incredible pasta. The Courtyard is for guests only. You feel as though you are in the courtyard of a tuscan villa. Also, the Front Desk staff is young, personable, and professional. They project only warmth and great hospitality unlike many other downtown hotels who portray an unwanted attitude. We cannot wait to come back for our next NYC trip!The Greenwich has everything going for it, a Tribeca location, Robert De Niro as an owner, and Andrew Cremillini as a chef. The decor makes you feel like you are in a cozy/sheek home. The rooms are all different, each with duxiana beds, which are extremely comfortable! They will put a mattress pad on the bed if you prefer a stiffer mattress. Additionally, we were in house for a long term stay. Therefore, prior to our arrival we were reached out to to ask if we would like an extra mini refridgerator in the room and if there were any groceries that we would like stocked. When we arrived into our Suite (book the fireplace corner suites, they have views of the hudson river and working fireplaces!). When we arrived all of our requested groceries were in the refridgerator, and a beautiful fruit bowl and bottle of red wine were on the table. This is the welcome of a hotel who knows how to do it right!My husband and I decided to do a "staycation" for our anniversary this year. We chose The Greenwich because we live uptown and figured downtown would be a fun change. When we arrived to the hotel, the staff warmly welcomed us by saying happy anniversary! Our room was not quite ready, as we arrived around 2 pm and check in is after 4pm but the bellmen kindly held our luggage as we cozied up in the Drawing Room. What a beautiful quiet space! The fire was roaring and we had delicious house made cocktails as we waited. Try their Pimms Cup, they add ginger beer, the best Pimms Cup I've ever had! The staff checked us in around 3 pm and gave us a nice tour of our room, where a complimentary bottle of champagne was waiting!"
"Also, have a couple's massage in their Shibui Spa, it is a great way to share your anniversary! We both had the healing birch, it was fantastic. I hear that the Shibui Spa is now open to the public, as New Yorkers we will definitely be back!The Greenwich makes you feel like you are a guest in their home. Request a courtyard facing room, it looks over their beautiful courtyard which provides serenity away from the busy city life. The Front Desk staff is very helpful, the coordinated and reccomended fantastic dinners during my stay. Will definitely be back!I was looking for a go-to hotel in New York that could be my home away from home when I frequently travel to NYC for business and/or also for leisure. The Greenwich meets all of our expectations. On the business side, i is a great homey place to come back to after a day of work and to have a breakfast meeting in their guest only Drawing Room. It is also extremely romantic as well as kid friendly. I brought my wife here for a long NYC weekend and she loved it. If you stay as a guest you will always get a hard-to-get reservation at Locanda Verde and during the warmer weather you can have this meal in their peaceful Courtyard. It is also extremely close to both FIDI and SOHO/West Village so the location could not be better! Make The Greenwich your Go-to, you can't beat it!As a Cornell alum, it was nostalgic to stay at the Statler and see the students running the hotel. I will say that it is one of the pricier options in the area, but for special trips to campus, it is definitely worth it. The Greenwich is the best downtown hotel in NYC!  We stayed at The Greenwich with our two children. The staff was extremely accomodating for our family stay. They welcomed our kids with delicious oatmeal cookies and adoreable stuffed animals in the room when they arrived as well as a bottle of wine for us! We found the hotel perfect for our stay as Tribeca is an extremely kid friendly neighborhood. The Front Desk staff even gave us a list of kid frienly activities in the area and they will assist with babysitting services as well! For uptown activities it was a very quick cab ride up the West Side Highway and we are so glad that we stayed downtown at The Greenwich. We are looking forward to our next stay!"
"Amazing hotel!  I was totally blown away by the service from all members of the staff. Never knew this hotel was even located here and I can;t wait to return.  All the little nice touches like being walked to the elevator to turndown service to a great bar scene with good food.  You will pay, but it is worth every penny!You will not want to leave this hotel!  WOW is all I can say.  Believe all the other reviews on here saying-this is a great hotel.  They remember your name and are always accomodating to every request.  True professionals in the art of hotel service.  The restaurant and spa are fantastic and not to be missed.I just spent an amazing weekend at the Umstead.  I justed stayed here with my wife for a birthday weekend and we had such a great time.  Everyone kepy wishing her happy birthday and they even sent some chocolates and champagne to the room.  You will be pampered from the moment you arrive to the time you depart.  Truly fantastic!What a great hotel in the triangle!  This area never had a luxury hotel and they finally have a great one.  I travel for business often to the area and can't wait to return to the Umstead.  It maked business travel a pleasure and not a chore.  They always remember my name and welcome me back.  There are bartenders in the bar that know my drink and always get a great welcome back in Herons for breakfast.Truly world class hotel!  I travel often and have stayed at many luxury hotels around the US and this hotel ranks up there with the best of them.  It is nothing over the top or flashy, it is having truly well trained staff that genuinely cares about the guests that makes the difference.  My husband and I visited the Market Pavilion in late August and I must say we had a wonderful stay. From check in to check out, the entire staff made us feel warm and welcome. The unique furniture and oil paintings really set this hotel apart from a nationwide chain hotel. We would definitely stay here again.Traveled to Charleston on business this past weekend, decided on the Market Pavilion based on an ad I saw at the airport. The hotel was well appointed and the staff was at my beckon call throughout my stay. Susanne, the concierge, was especially helpful in providing great restaurant recommendations and transportation for my business meetings. Be sure to try the in room dining as well, it is well worth the price tag.Decided to have my bachelorette party at the Pavilion Bar at the Market Pavilion Hotel. I was looking for some place that would be fun but not tacky or crazy. The Pavilion Bar was the perfect compromise. Situated in the heart of downtown, you can see beautiful views of the Charleston skyline. The servers went out of there way to accommodate our party and make my night special. If you are looking for a nice getaway to Charleston, and are willing to pay a little extra, the Market Pavilion Hotel is an excellent option. It is in a great location, right next to the market, and walking distance to almost anything that you would want to see. The in house restaurant is expensive, but the portions are huge and every bite is delicious. We loved the prime rib and ended our meal with their signature banana bread pudding. Don't let the price tag scare you, everything was worth it and you will not be disappointed.We recently stayed at The Statler while visiting Cornell on a college tour with our son. He is applying to the hotel program at Cornell so it was impressive to see the program's students in action at the hotel, as they were all genuinely interested in helping us in any way possible and even took the time to discuss classes and answer some other questions my son had about the program. By and far the best campus hotel we stayed at on our trip and hopefully we will have the chance to stay there again in the future if he gets into Cornell!My family and I typically travel to South Carolina to visit the beaches but this year we decided to add some history to our vacation this year and happened upon the Market Pavilion Hotel in Charleston, SC. Wanting to get as much information on the city as possible, we immediately headed to the concierge desk to find out more. Susanne was wonderful in getting us headed to all of the great sites nearby. She even arranged for a tour of Magnolia Plantation which was magnificent, be sure to include this on your itinerary. If you have accommodations elsewhere, at least stop by the Pavilion Bar on the rooftop for a drink, it has a great view of Charleston.Treated my wife to a special anniversary gift this past weekend with a night's stay at the Market Pavilion. Found the service and room to be truly first class. We really felt like we were receiving authentic southern hospitality. Allyssa at check in was very efficient and helpful. Haven, the doorman, also went above and beyond to make our stay unique and special. We will be back again next year!Originally booked online to stay two nights before traveling on to Savannah. But we had such a great time that we decided to stay in Charleston another night! Do not miss this hotel; if you are looking for an over the top grand hotel this is the place to go. Wonderful amenities, gorgeous room offerings, and fabulous customer service. Ask for Kelly in reservations to ensure you receive a top notch room with a view.We stayed here a few weeks ago and had a nice stay. We did run into a problem with our reservation when we checked in; we had originally booked a king bed room but they had us in a room with two queen beds. After speaking to a manager the problem was resolved though and we actually received an upgrade to the top floor! The pool on the rooftop is beautiful  but get there early as it does tend to get busy at the bar in the afternoon. Overall my husband and I had a great time and would stay here again if we ever return to Charleston.One of my favorite spots to stay at in the south! I travel to Charleston frequently on business and whenever I can I stay at the Market Pavilion Hotel. Susanne has been there for years and always helps me secure that tough to get last minute dinner reservation. Love the large comfy beds and each room has a different original oil painting. Can't wait to stay here again!Pros: perfect location right in the center of everything, beautifully appointed rooms and public areas, fresh flowers in guestroom, fitness center, and five star restaurant in the lobby."
"Cons: Coffee is taken away on the floor in the afternoon, would have liked to have a cup before going out."
"All in all we loved this hotel and would recommend to our friends and family.Absolutely the best hotel I have ever stayed at!  This was a definite surprise to find such a great hotel.  I have never heard of the hotel before and found it on an internet search.  It was an amazing hotel.  The grounds are beautiful, staff wonderful and gracious and fantastic restaurant.  Can not wait to return to the area on business to stay at this hotel.The Umstead hotel was everything that a luxury hotel should be.  You would never know that it was right off the freeway as you turn in you feel like you are in another place.  Lush grounds and attentive staff.  Get a lakeview room on the second floor with an extra large terrace to relax on.  Go to the spa and order room service for the ultimate escape.  Everything about this hotel gets it right.  Wonderful stay! I can't say enough nice things about this hotel.  It just feels great to be at the hotel.  When you arrive there is a sense of calm and you are surrounded with beauty.  The artwork, design, flowers etc. all come together.  The staff is always gracious and will bend over backward to make guests happy.  I have always felt well  taken care of when I stayed here.Five stars all the way!  I was here celebrating an anniversay and was just amazed at how well this hotel treated us.  We were wished a happy anniversay by at least 8 different members of the staff during our visit.  They upgraded our room to a suite and sent chocolate strawberries and champagne to the room.  We did a great couples massage in the spa and relaxed on the terrace by the pool.  Did an amazing  dinner in Herons one night and cocktails and dinner in the bar another.  What a perfect romantic weekend!I really enjoyed our recent visit to campus to visit our freshman daughter. We were upgraded to a room with a view of campus and the clock tower that was spectacular! We also had a great meal in the restaurant at the hotel, the lobster risotto was out of this world. All in all, another great stay at the Statler, we'll see you in March!The Umstead definitely exceeded my expectations in all areas.  The doorman always opened the door and greeted me by name each time.  The front desk staff we most helpful and efficient.  The breakfast servers in Herons were very attentive and room service was always on time-which is rare in a hotel.  Room was clean and refreshed every day and turn down was a nice touch.  It just seems like they have thought of everything.  Thank you for providing a wonderful experience.Loved, Loved, Loved our stay at the Market Pavilion Hotel!!!!  From the moment we stepped out of our car we were greated by a bellman in a tophat that set the mood for our stay in Charleston.  At checkin the front desk welcomed us with their southern hospitality.  The concierge was excellent with her recommendations for tours and dining.  Friendliest staff that anticipated our needs before we did.  Our room was luxurious with a great view of the market.  Can't wait to return to this fabulous hotel.Having traveled the world I have never stayed on a finer concierge level.  The concierge was superb and friendly to all the guests.  The breakfast was hot and delicious.  I especially enjoyed the grits and smoked salmon.  Afternoon tea was perfect before my nap.  There never was an empty glass in the concierge parlor during the evening reception.  The spirits flowed freely and the appetizers were plentiful.  Splurge on your next stay and book on the concierge level.Five stars!!!!  You must stay at this hotel while visiting Charleston.  I cannot say enough good things about The Market Pavilion Hotel.  My girfriends and I planned a girls weekend and we were treated like queens by the staff.   From the Hermes bath products to the bathrobes and slippers laid out during turndown service the amenities were luxurious and of the finest quality.  The rooftop bar is such a fun and happening place on the weekends with a live DJ.  Dining at Grill 225 was like dining in the finest NY steakhouse.  You don't even have to leave this hotel for fun, food and entertainment.Best location in town.  This hotel is located in the middle of the historic district and is surrounded by art galleries, fine dining and shopping.  Every historic sight downtown is within walking distance of this hotel.  After dinner we would walk to the Battery and enjoy the water and beautiful homes.  The rooms are spacious and have fresh flowers.  The housekeepers are so honest that everytime I left a tip on the pillow they would make up the bed and place the tip back on the pillow.  Finally I saw the housekeeper and had to give her the tip personally before she would take the money.  Extremely friendly staff that are always eager to help with ideas, directions and reservations.Can't wait to tell my friends about this treasure in Charleston.  While making reservations the reservationist was extremely patient with me in figuring out the best time to visit and explaining the different levels at the hotel.  We chose the concierge level.  The parlor was a great place in the evening to make new friends and swap stories.  The concierge went above and beyond in helping us book massages, mani/pedis, transportation and dinner.  No request was too small or too large for her to handle.  We already booked our return trip for my husband's birthday.  Perhaps this is the best hotel where I ever stayed. The level of hospitality is unparalleled. Everything is perfect: location, room, service and staff.  I was traveling on business and I couldn't have been more pleased with the attention to detail and staff follow through concerning a few special requests for my various business needs, meetings and dinner reservations. Dinner at Grill 225 is spectacular and you shouldn't miss this fine dining experience.Best location for tourists to stay.  Top notch rooms with quality decorations and extremely clean.  The rooftop bar is the hot spot in night life with the best view of Charleston overlooking the water and downtown.   We received a $50 food and beverage voucher for each night of our stay which we utilized in their steakhouse Grill 225.  The server was attentive, knowledgable but not hovering over us.  I have never had a finer steak.  It was so good that we ate there all three nights of our stay.  The staff at this hotel couldn't be friendlier or more helpful if they tried.  The General Manager was present and welcomed us to the hotel.  This is the only hotel in the historic district with a pool which is important when traveling with kids.  The lounge chairs have terrycloth covers and plenty of plush beach towels are provided for the guests.  The rooftop bar offers not only cool drinks but a variety of choices on the menu.  I had the Kobe burger and it was so large I couldn't even finish half of my burger.  Staff is attentive to your every need.  We didn't spend much time in the rooms but they even had childrens bathrobes laid out for the kids with slippers.  Too cute!!!  When staying in Charleston you couldn't choose a finer hotel.  Recently stayed for two nights at the Market Pavillion Hotel with our friends on the Concierge Level. As always our stay was first class. From the moment you walk through the door, you and your group receive a warm welcome from the entire Market Pavillion Family. We especially enjoyed the degree of service as well as the attention to detail that we received on the Concierge Level.  Within moments of our arrival our group was taken care of for the entire stay with charm and southern hospitality. "
"The staff are so nice and friendly they make you feel like you've known them for years.  I couldn't believe this hotel was only ten years old.  You would expect this kind of service at The Four Seasons or The Ritz Carlton.  Market Pavilion is the gem of Charleston.After recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels, I can definitely say i will be coming back. They offer so many in room amenities and services, Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be. My most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered, I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay ."
"Although much too overpriced in my opinion, the hotel is spotless. The staff was very courteous. And the spa service ? Was a God send ! In a relatively flexible location for traveling for sight seeing so I didnt spend major bucks trying to get around the city ! LOVE IT ! Going back for my anniversary"
"The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb. the room service was exemplary and the food, I don't even know were to start. The chef obviously knew what he was doing, I especially loved the seafood, my personal favorite was the shrimp. Aside from this, I loved how beautiful the hotel was. It is definetly a bargain for the price, for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but, I felt as if i was in a $10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe. great bang for your buck. Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city. My friends actually went their a while back because of me. They loved it! I know you will too."
"THIS HOTEL IS FANTASTIC. I stayed there on my way through Chicago towards Arizona, and could not believe the great quality of the hotel. I'd have thought I was in a Vegas suite. Really polite staff, great housekeeping, and amazing prices. On my way out, I was telling the manager about how much I'd loved the hotel, and he even offered me an extra night there! You can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly 24 hours."
"The Affinia Chicago is a wonderful place to stay, my husband and I stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time. The rooms were very well organized and comfortable, the staff there are very friendly, and the food there is more then amazing. we are defiantly going back next year."
"The magnificent mile in Chicago is a great place to visit, and staying at the Affinia Chicago just made it that much better! The location is awesome - all of the great shopping spots were just moments away, and getting to Navy Pier was a cinch! And the accommodations themselves were wonderful! The hotel lets you completely customize your stay, all the way down to choosing your own pillow! Very impressed overall!"
"My stay at the Affinia last weekend was ideal and I can't wait to return. I was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean, lovely room near the shopping downtown. Affinia fit the bill. The location was perfect, just one block from the magnificent mile. The decor was modern and sleek, and my room was impeccably clean. They even have a pillow menu! The price was pretty reasonable, too. I'll definitely be back."
"We recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed. The hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests, including individual pillow choices, complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit,and fine dining in two on-site restaurants, one of them roof-top with amazing city views. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago."
"We stayed for two nights for a meeting. It is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean. The service was very good, as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable. The rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses. The restaurant has good seafood, but was a bit expensive. We would come back again. "
"I just came back from this awesome, terrific hotel last week, and I have to say-- I loved it! My wife and I were there for a week due to a business meeting, and right when I stepped into the hotel, I knew that this business vacation will be well spent. The customer service was very great, and an employee even guided us toward our room! We were introduced to a fantastically lit room with 2 beds, a flat screen TV, and even free internet access. My wife loved it, and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap. When I headed down to the lobby for my conference, I got lost, and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held. He leaded me to the door, and I was very impressed. There is a fitness center which I went everyday, and this great restaurant called C-House situated nicely next to the hotel lobby, where I had a nice steak and my wife a salad. All in all, I thought that the trip was really worth it, and my stay was very welcoming at the Affinia Chicago. I highly recommend that whenever you visit Chicago you should stay there, you will not regret it. "
"I first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the Affinia Chicago hotel where I'm greeted by name by the concierge. He tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when I booked the stay. He shows me to my room (paying careful attention to my bags, and ensuring that I needn't lift a finger) sure enough, the down pillow I had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain, which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didn't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed. I notice that there's a display of champagne and cupcakes (!) atop the dresser and my "experience kit" which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks, and a yoga mat. namaste. Unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom, I find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower, but a jacuzzi, lined with candles of vanilla, deep enough to bathe a walrus. Feeling girlish, I run the water and test before going to dinner. The Hotel's restraunt C-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you're dining with the kings of paradise. or at least eating in the Caribbean itself. hmm, I should have brought a date."
"The Affinia Manhattan is fantastic! My husband and I stayed there when we went to visit my sister. I loved the room. It was one of the best hotel beds we have ever slept in. The view was incredible. Manhattan is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The staff was very helpful as well. They had no problem going out of their way to be helpful. I would suggest this hotel to anybody!"
"We just got back from a trip to Chicago for my 30th birthday and we could not have been more impressed by this hotel! Service was excellent, especially the maid service. Our room was so clean and fresh towels brought in daily. The front desk staff was some of the most professional and friendly staff I have ever dealt with while travling. The location is excellent as it is within walking distance of the best restaurants and stores. I highly recommend Affinia for a the perfect family vacation."
"I was in town to visit my cousin an stayed for three nights at this wonderful hotel. Its so close to the shopping i wanted to do with my cousin , granted i had a personal guide a.k.a. my cousin Janice. The amenities were unbelieveable an the service was great with the upmost hospitality. Would recomend to everyone great for kids an adults. The room and view were spectacular, the beds were very comfy and the room was emaculate."
"We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel. We found it conveniently located on E. Superior Street, near many local attractions. The rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel. The pillow menu was awesome, my partner and I have such different preferences, the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. The hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect! I couldn't believe the amenities available to guests. My Beagle, Betsy enjoyed her stay at the "Jet Set Pet" care center. She was pampered as much as I was. It was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership! Another feature I personally enjoyed was the Walking Tour Kit. It included an iPod Shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist, a deck of cards; guidebook that included walking tours, and comfort items like a towel and map! I felt like I was the most important guest (surely, everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms). Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel!!"
"My husband and I arrived for a 3 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary. We had booked an Executive Guest room, upon arrival we were informed that they would be upgrading us to a beautiful Junior Suite. This was just a wonderful unexpected plus to our beautifully planned weekend. The front desk manager was professional and made us feel warmly welcomed. The Chicago Affinia was just a gorgeous hotel, friendly staff, lovely food and great atmosphere. Not the mention the feather pillows and bedding that was just fantastic. Also we were allowed to bring out beloved Shi-Tzu and he experienced the Jet Set Pets stay. The grooming was perfect, the daycare service we felt completely comfortable with. This was a beautiful weekend, thank you Affinia Hotels! We would visit this hotel again! "
"The Affinia Hotel is beautiful! It's in a great location, the service is top-notch, and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. The look of the hotel is very modern, but it feels warm and cozy, too. The restaurant is amazing! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back! If you're planning a trip to Chicago, check this place out!"
"There were many positives when staying in this hotel at the north end of the Magnificant Mile. The rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with great attention to detail. The quality of service was excellent, the staff professional, and the location was perfect. There are great views of Chicago from many of the rooms. The staff seemed to care about the quality of my stay from the moment I was greeted upon arrival to the moment I got in my taxi to leave. There is a nice rooftop bar/restaurant perfect for a lite meal or a refreshing cocktail with great views of the city. There really weren't any negatives and I would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area."
"Friendly staff, clean building and rooms. The hotel was located nearby everything we were interested in seeing. Staff was willing to help give directions and very knowledgable of city. Rooms were beautifully designed and well lit, spacious and comfortable. "
"I took my family to the Affinia Chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous. My kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by. My wife was really stoked with Spaffina. The pampering and really made her feel special. And they are very attentive to pets also. My dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention.The hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels, so their Stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also. My favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content, which left me free to go over to Underground Wonderbar for a nice cocktail."
"Hotel Allegro Chicago is a beautiful place. I was originally dreading being in Chicago due to the fact it was all business and no play, but as soon as I saw the inside of the hotel I was stunned! I wasn't expecting to stay at a place that made business trip feel like a get-away vacation. The service there was amazing, everybody was very friendly. When I saw my room, once again my jaw almost dropped. The room was fit for a king, the designs on the wall were so elegant. The beds were extraordinarily comfy. I think for my next business trip I am going to bring my wife and kids with me. I give this Kimpton Hotel 5/5 stars!"
"When I had to visit Chicago for business I asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the Hotel Allegro. After my stay I can honestly say that I agree. From the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities, everything was thought of. The only place I find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home. I now know where I will be staying every time I have business in this city, and anyone I know who is doing the same will hear so."
"My wife and I stayed at the allegro this weekend while I was on a business trip. I was very impressed with their hospitality and my wife very much(maybe too much) enjoyed the in-house spa. Rooms service was a bit slow but, overall great hotel would stay again. "
"During a recent business trip to Chicago I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Allegro. The lobby gave a good first impression. It was a very clean with a modern designer's feel and the customer service was great. I proceeded to the counter to check-in and within 5 minutes I had the key to my room. I was told to check out the infamous 312 restaurant but I was tired from my flight. I checked into my room. The room was great. A king size bed 37" flat screen tv and standard desk all designer furniture. After I unpacked I had to check my email. Hooking up to their Wi-Fi was quick and painless! I had a good night sleep and early wake up the next day for my business meeting. I decided to try the restaurant for breakfast. I had an omelet and fruit. The restaurant was great and the food was perfect. I only wish I had more time to stay and enjoy lunch; nevertheless duty called. The concierge had my taxi waiting for me right after breakfast and I was off to work. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. It's one of the best I've ever stayed at after multiple business trips."
"My fiancee and I were looking for a modern, upscale venue for our wedding reception. We have found the perfect location at The James. From the ballroom to the personal attention to detail, each step was handled with care. Now that we have locked in our date, we are more excited than ever. Thank you staff at The James for making our day even more special!"
"My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago this summer. During this time we stayed that the Hotel Allegro. I knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations, the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous, and the whole process was quick, easy, and painless. Upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon, the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease. The rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent. Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up. "
"The Hotel Allegro in Chicago is understated luxury. I love the minimalist decor, and the linens were quality and exquisite. You can't beat the location, either, it's located in the heart of the theatre district. Walking distance to all the great restaurants in Chicago! They also offer an in-room spa service, which is pure decadence. I chose to indulge in the Eucalyptus Mani/pedi. It was by far the priciest manicure and pedicure I have had in my life (135 dollars) but it was a wonderful experience. The eucalyptus treatments left my hands and feet feeling so soft yet refreshed at the same time. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to experience the finer thingsthis gorgeous city has to offer."
"Extravagant, Exuberant Experience! Our stay at Hotel Allegro was very enjoyable. The intoxicating views made the get-away much more relaxing, as well as the exceptional room service. The rooms were very decorative and well above par. I very much enjoyed the complimentary tea. I Would highly recommend Hotel Allegro as a must stay vacation get-away."
"My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience! The staff were helpful and considerate, always there to tend to my needs. My suite was extremely clean, and had all the amenities that I could ask for. I almost didn't want to leave my room, because it was so nice. But in the end I did, because the hotel is situated in such a great area, that I had to go out and see some of the sites. This hotel has wonderful rooms and service, and is in a really great area. I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago."
"This was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks. I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. I made my way up to my room, which was spectacularly bright and well-lit, then I ordered some food. All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic. If I didn't have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day!"
" If you are traveling to Chicago and need a place to stay, I highly recommend the Hotel Allegro Chicago. It was visiting time visiting Chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the Hotel Allegro. He said they were pet friendly,which was a huge plus. This is because I hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time I travel for business. Upon my arrival, I was met with friendly valet who treated me like I was the only customer who mattered. I walked in and saw a hotel like no other I have seen before or after. The lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place I could relax in. After I had entered and checked in, I saw the staircase, which looked like a testament to the staircase in the "Titanic". Frankly, I was amazed and I had not even entered my room yet. My room was a Queen Deluxe room and it was amazing. The bed had a blue headboard,which I have never seen before, and the colors worked together so well I seriously contemplated living there. The room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food I ordered. Later I wanted to get a drink and I enjoyed it at The Bar 312, which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. These are the specifics of my stay, but there is much more to be experienced that I did not mention if you visit the Hotel Allegro. In summary, they allow pets, the service is amazing, the decoration superb, and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments. What more could a person ask for?"
"I went here with the family, including our dog Marley(They are very pet friendly). We really enjoyed it. This place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment. It also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event. I will definately be coming back next time I need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel!"
"For Top Class Treatment Choose Hotel Allegro. In all of my years of buisness travel and vacationing, I have never been more happy with the service at a hotel than I was at Hotel Allegro. I searched many hotel websites looking for the perfect hotel to spend our honeymoon, and Hotel Allegro seemed like the right choice. Soon as I walked into to their elaborate lobby area, it was like I was a big shot on Wallstreet, the service was excellent and the best part, they allow animals. They treated my little dog Johnny like he was royalty. They have everything you could ever need in a hotel, from in room spa service to a workout center. They even made sure that I had all of my drinks and amentites ready for the Monday night Bears game. If I were to give have to rate it from a 1 - 10. Id have to give it a 10 many times over. I highly recommend Hotel Allegro in Chicago Illinois and I will be back again."
"Having come to Chicago with my three sisters for a relaxing weekend of shopping and spa days, the Hotel Allegro Chicago filled every bit of my checklist. We arrived and immediately were checked in and shown to our rooms; we both had the "double double deluxe". The rooms were gorgeous, well taken care of, clean, comfortable, well decorated and luxurious. The hotel also has a spa which was perfect because we didn't even have to leave the hotel for our relaxing spa day. The hotel has great staff, they were always attentive to our needs. My favorite part was the complimentary tea and cofee - I am a coffee addict and getting my caffeine fix any time of every day was great! Stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago if you want great service from a relaxing and luxurious hotel in the heart of Chicago's hustle and bustle!"
"A few nights ago, I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago. I'd heard some amazing things about the great food, and how friendly the staff were. Upon arrival, the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time! The rooms were cozy, with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. I ordered breakfast the next morning, and had room service bring it up. The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering, and was delicious! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling, or any families staying in Chicago, as the rooms were very reasonably priced, and is a short distance to lots of great sites. Next time I come through Chicago, I will definitely be staying here! "
"I have to admit, I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia, but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago, my fears were slightly assuaged. A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before, and had nothing but positive things to say. With this new-found optimism in mind, I went forward on my journey in confidence. I have to say, I was not let down. From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I felt at home. The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms, and the check-in process was fast and efficient. The rooms themselves are incredibly homey, feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion. The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels, really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago, and provided a secure place to stay at night, or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group. Of course, the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. Overall it's very cozy, and has a certain old-world feeling to it, once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. It was never overwhelmingly crowded, and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly, yet not intrusive. I don't usually enjoy staying in hotels, but I love the Allegro Chicago!"
"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was very chic & upscale; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank. My wife even got to bring along her dog (aka #1 man!). I would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area."
"My friends and I were in Chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood. Well we came across the Hotel Allegro and immediately fell in love! Everything from the colors, the staff, the architecture, and the pricing were AMAZING! We couldn't have found a better hotel. The service was impeccable..talk about a 5 star hotel for someone with a 2 star budget! My friends and I plan on staying here next year when we return.. I can't wait until then! "
"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend. The hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive. The concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay, and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do. We were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel; the lobby, dining areas, and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury. The decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white, and lighting that complimented and set the mood. The bar and lounge areas had excellent service, and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown Chicago. Additionally, my husband and I were extra pleased to learn that because we are AAA members, we would be receiving 20% off our room rate for the weekend. Overall, the amenities and experience of staying at the Hotel Allegro Chicago made us feel like movie stars, pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment, one in which we would definitely choose to stay again."
"I recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to attend a corporate meeting. To say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement. I stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels. My room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style. A fully stocked refreshment center, wet bar, and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items. The Allegro is in the center of everything, the Chicago Loop of the financial district, the Chicago Theatre district, great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel (I suggest the 312 Lunch Club). The fitness room is well equipped and clean. The professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the Allegro. My next visit to the Chicago area will definitely include a stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago. "
"The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is a wonderful hotel. I had the opportunity to stay there on business and wished I could have stayed for longer. The staff is so nice and helpful. They really treat you like a VIP and are there to help with any questions you might have. The rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home. In my room I had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection. Did I say IN the room? I didn't even have to leave or order something on the television. It was nice to shower with their AVEDA products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me. While staying in for the night I was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel.The bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean! In the morning I was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage. Yes...ordered. They came to my room and I didn't even have to leave. Very comfy! This hotel was by far the best that I have stayed in and I travel a lot for business so I would know.You always have high expectations when you're staying at hotels and I'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded. I'm recommending this hotel to everyone I know that will be staying in the Chicago area. I will definitely be back and make reservations for a longer stay this time because I just didn't want to leave! I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars."
"My friend and I visited Amalfi Hotel last week when we were in Chicago and found it to be a great place, very sophisticated and luxurious, with lots of attention to detail in the decor and wonderful customer service. The beds were comfortable. The room service was great as was the gym... I fully enjoyed the views from the hotel room... so beautiful at night... the city scape. And in the morning, the free continental breakfast was delicious. It was a wonderful experience being at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. I am eager to visit there again. "
"If you have the money, Amalfi Hotel is the place for you. All the way from it's 316 thread count, Egyptian linens to the 24 hour fitness center. This hotel has anything you would need or want. The rooms are equipped with free wi-fi, 32in plasma televisions, multi-head showers and much, much more. You can do anything from fine dining and wine to working on the computers in the business center, which is equipped with computers free to your use. After a long night at the bar, you can get a complimentary breakfast at each floor. Over all the service is great as well. I recommend this hotel to any one from business professionals to young singles looking for a good time. I plan on coming back very soon."
"Amalifa Hotel in Chicago was an extremely pleasant and exciting hotel experience. I was taken away by the design and decor of the building and the exceptional customer service. I will definitely be returning for another stay!"
"I was visiting Chicago for a christening with my fiance. I was impressed with this hotel from the moment I checked in. The lobby was exceptionally modern with color and furnishings. Front desk staff was pleasant and helpful, especially Susan, who quickly suggested and reserved a table for us at Keefer's Steakhouse for a late dinner. The room itself was fabulous. Extremely comfortable King sized bed, dual head shower, breathtakingly beautiful views of the city, I couldn't ask for more. After a great nights sleep we awoke to a great FREE breakfast right outside our room! Next we enjoyed a couple's massage and I was treated to a facial as my fiance took a short run through the city. After a day full of shopping we retired to our room and ordered room service that was on time and delicious. Unfortunately we checked out the next day, because I could have stayed there forever. I fully recommend the Amalfi Hotel Chicago for everyone interested in a superior stay. It is truly a beautiful and well appointed hotel."
"Amalfi Hotel Chicago is just minutes from Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, the Chicago Opera Theater, The House of Blues, and the hottest night clubs. At $200.00 per night, you can expect the very best from your staff, and your accomodations. When I arrived for my weekend stay, I was greeted by a pleasant surprise of wall art, and eclectic style. After reaching my room, I was able to relax in peace on the numerous pillows. I didn't choose to use the spa this trip, but when I come back, it will be the first item on my list! The business office was great, because I had a last minute emergency with work- thank goodness for cocktail hour. Breakfast was delicious. I have already told a friend from Naperville that the next time I'm in town, she'll have to stay at Amalfi with me, instead of commuting. She really missed out! -Atlanta Girl-"
"The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was by far one of the best experiences I've had. It definitely felt as comfortable as home with the all the luxuriance of a five star establishment. I had forgotten my favorite CD that puts me to sleep each night. When mentioning this in front of the Front desk clerk, she told me that they have a huge collection of CD's available for guests. Low and behold, they had my favorite CD!! Also, my laptop was not cooperating. Come to find out, they offer every guest full access to their amazing and fully functional business center! From now on, when visiting Chicago, I will ONLY be staying at the Amalfi Hotel!"
"My husband and I stay at the Amalfi every year for our anniversary. We just love it! The service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. The hotel has very good cuisine options, which are all very tasty! The hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there. The rooms are very comfortable and quiet. Perfect for relaxing! Will definitely keep coming back!"
"This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at. From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food, Amalfi really exceeds its standards. The in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible. I highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5/5 stars."
"Great location in Chicago downtown. The staff is professional and warm. The room is spacious and clean. Nice complimentartry breakfast. I will definitely stay here again next time in Chicago."
"Last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to Chicago. When looking for a hotel we weren't all that interested in price, but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown. I did some research and and came across the Amalfi Hotel Chicago. What sparked my interest was it's location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments. Located in Chicago's river north area, it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours, both of which were fantastic! After a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments. My wife got the whole works (facial, manicure and pedicure, and hot stone massage therapy), while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day! For dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at Harry Caray's Italian Steakhouse. Best steak I've ever had, hands down. When we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed, put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful 32 inch HDTV's. For anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of Chicago, I would recommend The Amalfi Hotel Chicago to anyone. They offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more. "
"The Amalfi Hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago. This place really knows how to treat their guests. They serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have iPod docking stations in the room! If you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection. I took advantage of the free wi-fi AND the plush bathrobes. While I stayed there I had to try the spa services that were offered. Wonderful experience! The staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and I will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to Chicago. "
"I recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. I must say, that staying at this hotel is like staying at a high end hotel for celebrities. There are spa packages, room service, and the hotel is decorated extremely beautifully. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to be treated like a star. They take reservations, and also have a great restaurant right inside of the building. Whatever you need, they will accommodate you. This is heaven on earth! I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel, even if its for one day, its worth it."
"I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip. We decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. We enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. The individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. The Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. Our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. The hotel's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. Lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. Breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. Being of European descent, I enjoyed the croissants, whole grain muffins, real butter and marmalade. We also brought along our Standard Poodle, Sterling, and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. We purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. Sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling "at home" while away. For pet lovers this is a big plus. Finally, transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. This allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this, another appreciated bonus of our stay. Thank you Amalfi for a superb experience. "
"My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown, so he chose the Amalfi Hotel, located conveniently to everything we needed. This place was phenomenal!!! He chose a romantic getaway package, as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever. The hotel is super clean and very chic; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb. We were able to bring along our dog, which was also really important to us. The first day we were there, we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple's massage. The masseuses come straight to your room so it's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great. After our massages, we went to the Keefer Steakhouse, which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic. They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill, which was nice as well. In all, our 3 nights there were pretty similar, we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there; I've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City."
"Amalfi Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time. Its proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor's delight. It is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area, it is also close to the Loop, Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space. Each guest room includes a flat screen HD TV. The beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast. The 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business.The hotel has a no-smoking policy. It also has free internet facilities, room service, Air conditioning, laundry/drycleaning, multilingual staff to make communication easy, spa services, heating, conference facilities, satelite tv, brailed elevators and pets are allowed. The Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great. The hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty. The staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand. The hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean. The hotel makes it possible for you to relax, go shopping in the best stores which are close-by, eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership. They offer great deals for every type of customer. I would definitely recommend this place."
"having stayed in standard hotels before, when my wife suggested we stay in an upscale hotel for our weekend in Chicago I was skeptical to say the least. After staying at the Amalfi Hotel I may never stay in a regular motel again! Right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that *gasp* have a clue as to what they are doing. We got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site Keefer's Steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection. The room was spacious had robes and slippers, a stocked mini-bar, The mattress was comfy, and the whole room was clean. The staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife. In the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which I loved cause I love breakfast but not crowds. Unfortunately for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping, my wife was in heaven however, and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards. The whole trip I believe was made special by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff I would recommend the Amalfi to anyone visiting Chicago."
"This hotel allowed me to experience the best of Chicago. The central downtown location was perfect for me and my boyfriend to come and go as we pleased, whether during the day or at night. It was a great get-away spot for me to relax away from work. Probably one of the best beds I've ever slept on. The Italian food that they served at Harry Carey's reminded me of when I lived in Italy. Overall a completely amazing experience. I can't wait to book my next stay here."
"My wife and me stayed in the Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August in a weekend visit to Chicago. The hotel is located in the 20 W Kinzie St, in the well-known River North District. We got what the hotel promised: gentle staff, a luxury room with a breathtaking view, magnificent meals and a select wine. I also used its well-equipped gymnasium. We paid $586 with taxes for two nights. I think it was a good price, taking in account the excellent conditions we got there. I would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago."
"The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is perfect for a romantic get-away. My husband and I spent a weekend away from the kids there and I must say, we were impressed by the staff and the accomodations. We especially enjoyed the in-room spa service. I recommend the Amalfi to anyone wanting a nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area (you are within walking distance of shopping) with great customer service and luxury accomodations!"
"I got married in the Chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel. They had nothing but nice things to say about it! My husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs. The rooms are decorated so nicely and they don't have that funny hotel smell. The Pump Room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports. If I'm ever in the area again I will be sure to book a room at the Ambassador East Hotel!"
"My stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one. I loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping. I also loved the Pump Room. What a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary. The front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost. They found me a room immediately even though the city was book up. I thought the rooms were clean and well maintained. The shampoo was great and I decided to take it home with me. I am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago. "
"For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel, I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location. The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed, and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot. The food is good, location is great, everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here."
"The Ambassador East Hotel Hello my current visit to the Ambassador East Hotel. I really enjoy my 3 day weekend stay at this Hotel. This was my first time at the hotel and I reserved a king size suite. Inside my room there was nice view of Chicago's Gold Coast. I really needed to get some work done for my business trip and this room was perfect for the situation. I could easily relax on my king size bed. I watch HBO on a enormous size flat screen TV for free. Also when I did do my work there was nice wooden desk in my room with a desk lamp and wifi modem. It so nice to have my laptop with me and able to use it on a good workstation in my room. After finishing my work I have time to check the complimentary fitness room. Lastly I left the next day, I had one of the finest breakfast dishes from their Pump Room restaurant. Overall the Ambassador East Hotel is a 5 out 5 hotel and really worth the stay. "
"My husband and I came to the Ambassador East Hotel for my sister's wedding. The hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests. When we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were, helping us check and get our guests situated. They were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest's rooms. Our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed, with a view of the city. We held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall. After my sister was married in a church downtown, we held the reception in the large banquet hall. Again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner, the DJ and all of the wedding's decorations. We had a great time. Ambassador East Hotel is highly recommended!"
"Wow! Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago! It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier, Lake Michigan, and all the fabulous dining. The hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional, but cozy manner. The entire family loved it, even the dog...because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel! We loved the restaurant there, the Pump Room was great, something to please even the pickiest of our eaters. We were there on a family get-away, but asked to see a larger "suite". The suites were gorgeous. I can't wait to tell our friends about this place! Our next business trip to Chicago, we are booking at this hotel. They have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service! We are definitely coming back!"
"The Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago is a fantastic up-scale hotel to stay in while visiting the Windy City. My fiancee and I enjoyed one of the king rooms on our recent stay. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful - some of the best I've ever dealt with when traveling, and valet parking is always a perk! The rooms were very nice and had all the amenities you would want when at a high-end hotel. The bed was extremely comfortable! There was cable TV, of course, and HBO was included, so there was always something to watch. Wireless internet signal was excellent and I had no trouble getting online. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant twice during our stay, and the food was fantastic! Great atmosphere as well - we usually only do the hotel restaurant one night on a stay, but this one was worth going back to! Overall, it was an incredible stay, and we hope to stay at the Ambassador East again next time we're in Chicago! "
"I have to thank the Ambassador East Hotel for providing a really great experience for my family. We never leave our dog at home when we travel, and it's been a long time since we've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets. The staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques. My husband liked the fitness room. It was nice and clean, with plenty of extra towels available. It was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water, but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. We will definitely be staying here next time we visit Chicago. We would make the trip just to stay here. That's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel."
"Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. From the moment we checked-in until we left; the staff, from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating. Since we had our two daughters with us, we booked the traditional double room. The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too. It had plenty of room for the four of us--or should I say five of us. The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi, our teacup Chihuahua. Fortunately, the Amabassador East allows small pets (with a pet waiver). That made everybody happy! The location is great as well. Conviently located. Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive. Close to the museums. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago. I'll be staying here again!"
"This was the best choice my husband and I could have chosen to visit! The Hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water! I was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym. Everything was so clean and invoting. Especially The Pump Room; there was so much history in one rooom. Overall, we had a great, relaxing vacation away from the kids. I would definitely return to the Ambassador next time we're in the area!"
"From the moment I stepped into the Ambassador East Hotel, I was very much impressed!! The entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. The bell staff escorted my husband and I right up to our suite. Our suite was beyond belief. The atmosphere was very classy and romantic. My husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived. We had traveled to Chicago, from New York, for a romantic weekend get away. We had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant, The Pump House, and were very pleased. Dinner started with soup and a salad, main course meal and dessert, all for a reasonable price. We did a little local shopping the next day, after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds. Every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience. We enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the Ambassador East Hotel the next time that we are in Chicago, Illinois. 5 stars...."
"amazing and beautiful! i stayed two nights here and the room was immaculate. All of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming. The food was delicious and fixed to perfection. The entire hotel was clean, warm and inviting. Will definitely stay here again and recommend to any of my friends traveling to the area."
"How should I start? Well, after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel, i realized it was my favorite hotel ever. The rooms are amazing. The food is great. The Pump room bar is awesome. I love this hotel. If your ever in Chicago, the Ambassador East Hotel is the place to go."
"If you're looking for an elegant hotel in downtown Chicago, you have to stay here. The Ambassador East Hotel has very comfortable and beautiful large rooms and is like a home away from home. The perfect place for a business person, and if you have a small pet you can bring them too! I would give this place four stars and would definitely stay here again."
"The Ambassador East Hotel is a business that certainly strives to keep its customers satisfied. Upon my entrance at the Ambassador East, I was greeted warmly. The staff was incredibly pleasant, and the accommodations were top-knotch. The food served at the award-winning "Pump Room" was to die for, and the service was fast but friendly. "
"O.M.G best hotel ever ! i've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish. evan at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed , how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . ohh . and the pump room , the best food i've evr had at a hotel . i evan got to take a picture with Queen Anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid's stayed here . and it's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs . ( all the places to be at least )"
"I am writing about my recent stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. I just wanted to let you know what a wonderful team you have working there. Everyone from check-in to check-out couldn't have been more helpful or personable. It made my mundane business trip a very pleasureable one. The hotel is spotless, very comfortable and the restaurant is one of Chicago's finest. You really offer the finest quality in both product and service. The only complaint I have is that internet access is not free. I would just like to mention one person in particular- Sofie. She worked on the front desk and she went above and beyond to make my stay as smooth as possible. She even helped me out with taxi services and local recommendations. I shall look forward to returning next month. Thank you. Yours, P. Grady "
"I enjoyed my stay at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago. The staff was friendly and helpful from the time I checked in all the way through checkout. The hotel was very clean and well maintained. The beds were very comfortable! The hotel restaurant/lounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day. The only thing I was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel. I reccomend this hotel and I will stay there again on my next trip to Chicago!"
"The Ambassador East Hotel, located in downtown Chicago, is one of the BEST hotels I've ever stayed in. My wife and I went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the Ambassador East on a hotel booking website. Their rates are very, very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide. I was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and couldn't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend. I was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer, which is nice because most places in Chicago are very impersonal. All in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area. 5/5 Stars. "
"The stunning bay at Chicago finds its equal in the Ambassador East Hotel. This hotel feels like luxury was built into everything, down to the wonderful room service and conference rooms. Besides being in an active neighborhood in Chicago, the Ambassador East is close enough to the action and beautiful sights Chicago has to offer. The overall service of the hotel was wonderful. I felt like I was treated as a king. The room was very neat, regal, and relaxing. I especially liked the bathroom as it was clean and soothing. The Pump Room was also a great place for excellent dining. My stay here was completely enjoyable while maintaining a high level of productivity. Overall, the stay here was fantastic and worth every penny. I would return to the Ambassador East Hotel in a heartbeat if given the opportunity."
"Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip. The first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is, and how clean the rooms are (even compared to other luxury hotels) seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the Terrace and get a drink, i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed, i've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones, once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent, bed was soft and the TV didn't appear burned out at all. Overall i give this a five out of five, the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect, i wish i could have stayed longer."
"The Talbott Hotel was very classy, professional, and luxurious. I loved how the staff was nice and respectful. I was treated like i was royalty when i was there, when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel. They took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done. This is a very nice and modern looking and their rooms are spacious and clean unlike other hotels in their area. I have recommended this hotel to all of my family and friends and would recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in that area. "
"My wife and I booked a Deluxe Accessible Room at this beautiful hotel for three nights. The wonderful photos don't do the hotel justice. It couldn't have been a more ideal stay. The room was spacious and and clean, the bathroom sparkling, with every amenity one could imagine. The bed felt like it had been just delivered. Our views of downtown Chicago were spectacular. On top of all of this, the hotel staff was extremely helpful. They explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at, and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy! Believe everything good that you read. If you visit Chicago, stay at the Conrad Chicago."
"We stayed here for a weekend trip to Chicago and we will come back and stay here again. It was great place front desk clerks were very helpful.Also we loved the view. Very nice quiet place and upto date and super clean. We will def stay here again highly recommended."
"My visit to the Conrad Chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none. The lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style. The rooms are beautifully adorned. I especially like the flat screen TV and wired internet. I'm never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast, reliable internet connectivity, and it's included at no additional charge. The view from the room was magnificent...downtown Chicago at night! The Restaurant is spectacular but the Terrace is the place to be when weather permits. You cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods. Don't forget to visit the Health and Fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment. The staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need. Just ask! This is the place to stay in Chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury!"
"The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure. Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable, but the food in the restaurant was exquisite. Not to mention the perfect service from the resort's employees! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs. I'm naturally a fitness freak, so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor. Best of all, it was available to guests at any time, day or night. The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area, so it wasn't a far walk to scope out the shops. The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up. It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life. I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave. Any time that I make my way back to Chicago, you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago. I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling."
"This hotel is absolutely amazing. I have paid to stay in Hotels that cost an arm and a leg only to get crappy service in return. However, here it's comfortable, friendly, and a vacation. In fact, all vacations start with your lodging, and how can you have a good vacation with poor lodging? The beds are comfortable, clean, and upscale, while still being homey enough to be relaxed. The services and staff are tops, and the view from the rooms is absolutely gorgeous! And I must commend the cleanliness! Nice place to stay, and worth every penny! Will definitely be coming back! "
"The hotel was very nice; Service was great, everyone was very friendly. The room was very elegant and classy. The bed was so comfortable. The room also had a flat screen TV and Bose sound system. Not bad. Overall I had a great experience; with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room, I left here well rested and happy. "
"If you are looking for a luxurious downtown Chicago experience, the Conrad Chicago is the place to stay. The rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding, a 42 inch flat screen television, a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub, and views of downtown Chicago that will take your breath away. The hotel has many amenities for you to enjoy while you are there including great restaurants and bars, high speed internet, a fitness facility and laundry services. This hotel was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown Chicago."
"I stayed at the the Conrad Chicago Hotel last winter with my family and I couldn't be happier with are choice. The staff was very polite and helpfull and the rooms were very comfortable and felt like home. I loved the area of chicago the hotel was in there wasnt alot of crim around and i felt safe being in a new city."
"Conrad Chicago it was 5:00 AM my plan just flew in and I was tired I checked myself into the Confad Chicago when I first got there there was a creepy employe the floor was filthy but I got my room in the 5th level of then as I dashed towards the elevator my suite case in hand I entered it then that's where I started to see the beauti of the place the walls where polished wood there was even a small AC/heater unit and it was good. Then out of no where Ting I made it up there this place was great the carpets where velveteen it was a true luxurious hotel I found my rooms and was greeted to a golden door nob I was living in paradise after I got into my room it was a perfect! The room was a perfect 68 degrees. I was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was... perfect! And it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when I didn't think it could get any better I look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold! The water actually has a good taste to it like grapes I was so shocked I fell uncontentious I was drowning cause my face fell into the toilet then I woke up you wont believe how fast the assistance will save your life there! I when t back up into my floor and guess what I say out the windows a swimming pool and it was huge Olympic sized swimming pool It was great. I got on my beach suit and went down there and it was heated over all I don't think I can leave and all of the other swimmers where pretty nice rich people and they where alright though a little big stuck up but not too much. Then came dinner time perfect. I must say I am extremely satisfied with my visit! Time to fly back to where I cam from and then my plan took off i'm going to miss that hotel 10/10!"
"I had a great experience staying at the Conrad Chicago, the service was top notch, the price was good, but out of everything the service was outstanding. I would definitely stay there again when in the area and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good quality hotel in a great location. Right next to the shops at North Bridge!"
"If you're looking for luxuary, look no more. The Conrad is the best. I was in Chicago on business, and had to stay much longer than anticipated. A coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did. The location is perfect, you're close to everything. The best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel. I'll be back soon. Very Satisfied"
"My wife and I checked in to this hotel after a rough flight from Los Angeles. We decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel while visiting our recently graduated son, and we were not disappointed. The location could not have been better, as we were afforded easy access to Chicago's culture and shopping by being just off Michigan Avenue. After a long day of exploring the city, we enjoyed a fantastic dinner on the terrace overlooking the city. The halibut was cooked just right, and our waiter made us feel very welcome with some friendly conversation. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Chicago! "
"My husband and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago on our 1st anniversary tripped and had a WONDERFUL experience thanks to the staff. Not only is the hotel and a great location with many places to eat and socialize within walking distance, but they rooms were also clean and quiet. The staff was helpful and accommodated our requests. We'll definitely be staying here again next time we visit Chicago! Also if you stay you MUST eat at The Restaurant. Fabulous food!"
"We were amazed by this hotel. The first great part is the location. Its so close to some of the great shopping the city has to offer. The view from the terrace suite at night was breathtaking looking over Chicago. They even had a florist, as I bought my wife a rose. The menus, the lobby, everything was fantastic. The room was clean when we arrived as it was every time we came back to it each day. I didn't use the fitness center but it looked very nice, I did however visit the bar....and when i return to Chicago, I will again."
"Having recently been in Chicago for business and based on proximity and aesthetics, I decided to reserve a room at the Conrad Hotel in Chicago and I couldn't have been more delighted with every aspect of my two-night stay. Every conceivable amenity is available from the 42" plasma flat-screen to both wired and wireless internet connections available I was able to stay in constant contact with the office all while in the enviable lap of luxury. My room was not only comfortable and clean, but warm and inviting just as if it were home away from home. If you're in the Chicago area, reserve a room at the Conrad Hotels and Resorts and you will not be disappointed. "
"The rooms were beautiful! The staff was friendly and helpful. I love where the Conrad in Chicago was located, it seemed to be close to a lot of places I wanted to visit. Chicago was great, and the Conrad Hotel made my family and my stay that much more exceptional!"
"Conrad Chicago is one of the nicer hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in recently. The rooms were well furnished and brightly lit, but not to the point of garishness. The convenient location was a plus."
"I went to stay at this hotel last year. I have got to say it was a great authentic experience, the dining Restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff. Its location couldn't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping. Looking at it from the outside at night is very beautiful. It is very affordable. I recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town."
"WOW! That is all I can say! My girlfriends and I recently went on a little 'excursion' to Chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at this beautiful hotel. The rooms were beautifully decorated in a comfortable, modern style. The beds were so comfortable and cozy with the softest bedding I have ever felt on a hotel bed. Our views were just as amazing. We could even see Lake Michigan from our suite. We only dined in the hotel once during our trip, but it was the best time we had. The Aria Restaurant was so elegant yet fun. Very clean and just a great atmosphere. The staff was extremely professional and courteous, going out of their way to ensure our stay was a pleasure from the moment we walked through their doors. Highly recommended! A must see next time you visit this area. "
"The Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park Hotel provides a rich, beautiful, cultured atmosphere. During my stay, I felt like royalty. With unparalleled design schemes and beautiful, tranquil views, the mood during my entire stay was one of bliss. The guest services department was second-to-none. The staff throughout the hotel were obviously concerned with pleasing the customer and making my stay as wonderful as possible. When dealing with a staff member at Fairmont, I felt as if I were the only guest in the place. The food and drink selections were vast and fit for a king. I will definitely recommend Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park to my friends and colleagues. I will also greatly look forward to my next stay."
"Fantastic Hotel! Upscale and luxurious, and in a great location! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty! The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean, the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for! My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone, and can't wait to get back there myself!"
"My three night stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect way to end a weekend. The hotel has a classy but warm atmosphere with color tones that please the mind and soothe the eyes. The staff was ready to help at any notice and always greeted you with a cheerful smile. The mySpa was the getaway of a life time. My only complaint would be that the bed covers were a bit too stiff as they were new and clean but the softness of the bed whisked me away to a deep slumber in no time. Well worth the money and I know my next stay will be much longer. "
"When my new fiance told me about his business trip to Chicago I was quite annoyed. Mostly because he insisted I come along. He made up for me so not wanting to come along and be alone all weekend, with this wonderful hotel. His mother told him all about this hotel when she and her husband stayed here in the summer of 2008. She loved it..and so did I! I was so bummed about being all alone for most of the weekend, but the decor, wonderful staff and massages made up for it! I spent my time in the spa and the asian restaurant and couldn't have asked for a better experience! I am definately coming along on the next business trip!"
"My husband and I visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park for our honeymoon. The customer service was amazing. From the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing. These people were proficient, respectful and very thoughtful. The Fairmont had a lounge, a wine room, a bar and a restaurant. I couldn't decide where I wanted to go first! After we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room... It was totally delicious. We also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon! Then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa, once again excellent!! Everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time. We stayed in the gold room. Although it was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be I was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows. My husband and I relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city. It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget. Four thumbs up! "
"Fairmont Chicago was a great choice for my wife and I. We couldn't resist the elegant Aria Restaurant and the accommodations. The room was impeccably clean and the city view was utterly amazing. From the moment we checked in, the staff produced a positive atmosphere with genuine hospitality. My wife even suggested we should have had our wedding reception in their beautiful ball room. Overall, I would rate Fairmont Chicago a 10/10!"
"I just spent the weekend here with my wife, and she loved it as much as I do. I was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients, so I didn't have any choice. But when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago, I knew this was the place to take her. The hotel hasn't just been remodeled, it's been completely redesigned. Things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better, and the two rooms that I've seen are showplaces. They are amazing. This hotel is part of a luxury chain, and it's easy to see why. They offer full room service at convenient hours. I've been in every eating area now, and they are all great, too. Whether for business or pleasure, you can't beat this. It's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you'd expect. My wife was stunned, and yours will be, too. "
"I recently made a business trip to Chicago, in which I stayed at the downtown Fairmont hotel. During my visit, I had an aroma-harmony massage. This experience greatly relieved my stress, from all the business meetings I'd had that day. Candace worked wonders for my neck muscles, especially. This was the only amenity that I sought out, during my trip. My time was very limited. However, the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if I were a valued guest. I'll definately stay at this hotel again when I'm in the area. And, I highly recommend the spa!"
"My husband and I went to Chicago for three nights for a quick get-away. We chose Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park because it was located at the heart of the city, downtown Chicago. The hotel itself was very elegant and modern. The bed was extremely comfortable and I was able to wake up with music from my iPod. I would definitely stay with them again."
"I had to write this review! My tired body walked through the doors of The Fairmont. It felt like I walked through heaven's gates, the lobby was majestic and the staff was so friendly, that I was instantly energized. The front desk staff was very helpful and quick to find my reservation and get my bags up to my room. They were so nice to inform me of the health club and spa..oh those wonderful spa treatments that are offered are incredible, I took advantage of a soothing pedicure during my visit (my very first) as well as a massage. I was amazed at the size of the meeting/conference room that we used for an afternoon. The room was so clean and the bed was better than the one at home. The food downstairs in the restaurant smelled so good that as tired as I was after the meeting, instead of room service, I went in,and the food was mouth watering delicious, and the wait staff was very hospitable They take great pride in everything, even the wake up call was friendly. My stay was so great, that I want to go back again soon!"
"I have just returned from my first stay at the remodeled Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and all I can say is fabulous! The modern decor and style hits you the minute you walk in. The front desk is a work of art. I stayed in the anything but standard guestroom. The modern decor, the beautiful artwork, this is the most relaxing hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bathroom is like having your own personal spa, all the marble tile is classic and modern at the same time. The rainfall showerhead is to die for people. If you have the time be sure to check out the fitness center and spa. Great new equipment to work up a sweat and all the pampering a body could ever needs awaits in the spa. I wish I could have stayed longer, next time I will be sure to add a couple of "me" days to my trip and I'm sure I won't even think of going outside those doors."
" While travelling for business I had my family join me and we stayed at the Fairmont Chicago, Millennium Park. It is breathtakingly beautiful and plush. The rates for rooms, though not the cheapest choice are quite reasonable for such fabulous amenities. The room decor is elegant modern and my wife says the spa is divine! Guests of this hotel are able to live in luxury - every room is equipped with complementary coffee, access to high speed internet, bathrobes, and 42 inch flat screen televisions. Enjoy the gorgeous city views and live the good life at the Fairmont Chicago, Millennium Park. "
"My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago. I loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and iPod docking station. I appreciated the walking distance to all of Chicago's premiere shopping areas. The concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations, while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service. The services I received at at mySpa were some of the best in the world. Dinner at aria restaurant was delicious. In short, Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect luxury vacation, meeting all my needs and more!"
"The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable; it has a very modern feel. The rooms were very well designed, and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means. The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable. "
"My husband and I stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it. It is so conveniently located close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The staff was very helpful and the room was great. It was definitely worth every penny! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago."
"We recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park while travelling for business. What an incredible experience! Friends had stayed there years ago, but when we showed them our photos, they couldn't believe the amazing renovations. While we loved the modern decor and style, our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call Fairmont PURE rooms. I have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling, so I wasn't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room. I have to say I felt great during our entire stay. We enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at Eno. What a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel. This hotel is truly beautiful, everything you would expect from a high-end, big city hotel. Our stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park didn't disappoint us in any respect. Our only disappointment? We don't have a reason to go back to Chicago anytime soon, but I have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future. "
"This hotel is amazing, I would recommend everyone to stay at least one night here if they had the chance. I stayed here on my first honeymoon and they had all the accommodations I expected plus more. I was floored by the friendliness of the staff and they definitely went the extra mile to make everything perfect without any hassle. The restaurants at the Fairmont were amazing as well. When staying at this Hotel, food and wine at their best are portrayed. If I had to make the choice to stay here again, the only thing that I would do differently is schedule the stay to be twice as long (it was so relaxing!!). Already booked another stay for next year I enjoyed it so much. "
"My husband and I recently visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel on one of his business trips. I sometimes go along with him to see new places and to splurge on a mini-vacation while he is hard at work (don't worry- he likes when I return with little "souvenirs" for him, too). Aside from the lovely city of Chicago, this hotel was just amazing! We had gotten in quite late that evening from our flight from Houston and were so tired! The staff was genuine and friendly, all while being professional and prompt. We were quickly checked in and before we knew it we were in our beautiful room. Too tired to really take it in, we were in bed and asleep in minutes. The beds were quite welcoming! It wasn't until the next morning that we were able to really take in all of the beautiful features of this hotel! It's gorgeous! Everything was so clean and wonderfully decorated! The lobby somehow didn't make it into our sleepy eyes the night before, but it was just lovely! Later that evening we decided to eat at their sushi restaurant. Sushi is one of my husband's favorites, so he tends to be picky. They passed the test according to him! We also enjoyed a glass of wine there as well... everything tasted great and was of excellent quality. Of our two night stay there, the only downfall was one occasion of there not being enough towels (I use a lot of towels I suppose). However, a simple phone called prompted a quick delivery of fluffy additional ones. This however was only a minor bump in the road to an entirely enjoyable and relaxing stay! Overall-- we'd love to go there again! Maybe next time I can talk my husband into taking advantage of the spa... *wink* "
"The windy city fairmont hotel is one of chicago's best recently renovated to bring it up to modern day luxury. With fine dining atmosphere and hotel deluxe suites and the view that is breath taking. This hotel can accommodate the guest no matter what you desire. with a fabulous restaurant on the 15Th floor with dinning at its best. With it over looking the great Chicago area. So the next time your in the windy city come and stay with us where you will be pamper by our fine staff."
"When I planned my summer vacation, I was wanting to travel somewhere new. Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life. I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel. It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there. The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues. The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious, I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied. I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town. I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later. "
"When I first booked my reservation at this hotel, honestly, I didn't know what to expect. I mean, I'm kind of a music person, but this was my first real experience with a musically "themed" hotel. Upon staying here, however, I am convinced that I made the right choice in my stay. The dining accommodations were excellent, and I was served probably some of the best food I've ever eaten at a hotel. It was intelligently placed in downtown Chicago, and I wouldn't have to walk too far to see some street performers, or just take in the majesty of the city itself. The room I had booked had an excellent view of the skyline, and I could've easily sat for hours, just marveling at the city sprawled out before me. The whole "Hard Rock" and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay. If I had to stay here again, I would! "
"The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has it all: location, comfort, and rockability! We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently and found it to be amazing! The location was perfect as it is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and Lake Michigan. It was just a short ride by bus or cab to the sports stadiums, Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science and Industry! The food, although it was pricey, was great! There is a spa on site if you need a little time to relax and recoup after all that rockin', and if you have pets, they get the ROYAL treatment, complete with gifts! I would highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel of Chicago! "
"Hard Rock Hotel is a must to visit. No matter what city your in Hard Rock Hotel is the place to stay. Filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining. This Hotel is the place to be. Great views in every location, especially Chicago. The service is incredible along with the food and decor. The Hotel staff will help you feel right at home, no BETTER than home :)"
"I was looking for an unique, hip experience in a hotel that offered the convenient location of downtown Chicago. My choice for hotel was obvious: Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. If you are wondering whether Hard Rock Hotels are schmaltzy or cliche, they are not. Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is modern, trendy and hip. It had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories, and there are details that you won't find elsewhere. For example, one interesting perk is some free iTunes downloads (I got ten) for guests. It's a fun place, hosting events such as Jack Daniel's 160th birthday."
"-Review of the Hard Rock Hotel- I find that the Hard Rock Hotel, located in Chicago, has extrodinary scenary. The hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking. Hungry? Visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables. The hotel also host events such as ballet, fun in the bar and a dj to name a few. This hotel is definitely worth your while. I will most definitely visit again. Book your reservation as soon as possible and don't forget your camera!"
"I traveled to Chicago recently with my giant German Shepard dog Rex and picked the Hard Rock Hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. The service truly is incredible. They even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after. The rooms really rock (pardon the pun). Nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. The easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out, but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets. "
"While making the obligatory trip to the Chicago area to visit family, we decided to make it fun for the teenage members of our group and reserved a couple of rooms at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. What a great decision! The rooms are very upscale at a reasonable price with great amenities. And, according the younger members of the family, "very cool"! We can't wait to come back."
"Set up an important meeting for some clients at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. They were flying to Chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company. Naturally, they wanted to stay here. The client really seemed to like their rooms, but felt the Paul Reed Smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting (330 sq ft.). In a panic, I contacted the HRH staff and they actually had another, bigger, room available. We quickly moved our meeting in the Birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success. (Birdland room is 660 sq ft.) We have a new client and so does HRH. This is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us."
"I have to say that the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is a cool place to stay. When I first got there, getting checked in was very fast. The lady at the counter was nice and well spoken. The bellhop had out bags into the room very fast. The room was very hip and cool. There was musical items all over the place. I really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom. After being in the room a few minutes, I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room. They also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room. I needed some things shipped while I was there, which they had supplies to help me with that. After getting some work done, I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around. They gave me information for 3 awesome places. I left and came back after having a night out on the town. They were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it. I had more than pizza that night if you get my drift. When I got back to my room, the bed was so comfortable. I feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep. In the morning I order breakfast, which was really a Philly cheese steak. They will make anything you want anytime of day. I checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed. Thank You Hard Rock, You Rock!"
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago and we can't wait to go back! The hotel is located in downtown Chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city, we were close to everything. The Hard Rock Hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking. The room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings. The bed was heavenly. The hotel staff was friendly, upbeat and extremely helpful, we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both. I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
" The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is great alternative to ordinary hotels. The hotel is decorated with a huge variety of music memorabilia that makes the stay worth it alone. The hotel is often visited by many talented artists including singers, dancers,actors etc. The staff were very polite and helpful and always pleasant. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated, as were the common areas and hallways. I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area."
"Upon arriving to the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, I was immediately impressed. The staff was friendly and checked us in quickly, which is important to me after a long trip. Our room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style. The bed was very comfortable, including the linens which felt high quality, unlike what you get at some other hotels. All this made for a great night sleep. Perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was their "Party like a Rottweiler" package we added to our reservation. For an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats, toys and best of all the pet cam! We left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iPhone! All in all this was a great place to stay and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet."
"This fantastic hotel has it all: luxury, an excellent location and a fun atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and well decorated, and the staff is always helpful and courteous. Whether you're traveling for business or fun, I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. I stayed there with my wife recently, we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun. The Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for. The hotel is in a central location, within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city, however, there's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for, so there's barely a need to leave to hotel! (well, we DID leave the hotel to see the sights, but you know what I mean). My wife and I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities, including a relaxing massage. This hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way, and we'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the Windy City. "
"I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago while in town for business, and enjoyed my stay very much. I stayed in a room with a king bed, which was very comfortable. The room had all the things I needed for my stay, which was nice. The only thing is I think there was a party on my floor, but they quieted down quickly enough. My room even had an internet connection! I also had dinner one night at the China Grill, and it was an amazing meal! Overall, I had a great stay, and will return next time I am in Chicago."
"My husband and I recently stayed at your Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, and what a fantastic experience it was. We stayed in one of the 'Extreme Suites' and let me tell you it was beautiful. The furniture and paintings were amazing and the view was to die for. The staff treated us really well and met all of our needs and then some. I especially loved the spa. We stayed for a week but I could have stayed a lot longer. It was very comfortable and welcoming. We will make sure to recommend your hotel to our friends and will be back the next time we are in Chicago. Thanks so much!"
"I loved staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, not only is it an amazingly friendly atmosphere, but they give me the option to bring my pet with me. They are a dog friendly hotel, it costs $55.00 a night for the dog to stay with you, but that beats the costs of paying a kennel to keep or your dog or a neighbor to watch them for you. I loved this option. They also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats, food, bowls and doggy clean up bags. I higly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for a place to bring your four-legged friend with you when you travel. "
"Staying at the Hard Rock Hotel is one of best bets you can ever make while traveling. I stayed at this one the last time I visited Chicago and it was just wonderful. The rooms are amazing and the one I stayed in had a great view of the city. The beds were comfortable and everything was really clean and neat, the Wi-Fi was really fast and always available and I liked the fact that you could get a guitar at the front desk and jam in your own room with a pair of headphones. I didn't have the chance to use the spa, but I could tell it was really nice and relaxing. I did go to the Base Bar a couple times for a drink, very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from. The Rock shop was pretty cool too and I bought a bunch of shirts to bring back home to family and friends. Overall I think this is one of the coolest hotels you could stay in, the experience is definitely different than any other hotel I've stayed in."
"After searching for the perfect hotel for my Chicago getaway I knew once I came across the Hard Rock Hotel, that this was the hotel for me. After seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered, I booked my reservations right away. When I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept. I was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes. I was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants. I took the elevator up to my room, and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable. After relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast, courteous service I received. After my cocktail hour, I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven. I had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time. I highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did, and I can't wait to return. Ashley B."
"the experince at the hard rock hotel in chicago was fantastic,i will rate them a 6 out of 5. they have wonderful service and great staff and the view is just wonderful."
"My husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago,and enjoyed every minute of it! The bedrooms are immaculate,and the linnens are very soft. We also appreciated the free wifi,as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago. The bathroom was quite spacious,and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos. Their service was amazing,and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool. I would recommend staying here to anyone."
"The Hilton Chicago was amazing!! It is close to almost everything that Chicago has to offer! We could walk to Lake Michigan, Grant Park, Niketown, Watertower place, etc. The rooms were very nice and refreshed every day. Also, they allow pets!! You don't have to go far to get good food because they have a few different restaurants right there! Overall experience was an A++."
"Excellent hotel in the heart of Chicago. The room we stayed in had a great view of Lake Michigan. We went in July for a vacation and everything is easily accesible from the hotel. Most major attractions are in around the Loop area. We also got a great deal on the price. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago - its in the right spot for both business and pleasure."
"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. The service was impeccable. Not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there."
"The Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. Staying with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always, the room was clean and impeccably neat, the staff friendly and very capable. The wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too! Best of all, it is a pet-friendly hotel, something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. Thanks, Chicago Hilton, for a great stay!"
"The Chicago Hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic. The hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city. The room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful. I can't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there. "
"My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay! The rooms were large and comfortable. The view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous. Room service was really good and quick,eating in the room looking at that view, awesome! The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. Great location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums. Very friendly staff and knowledgable, you cant go wrong staying here. "
"My stay here was superb. The view from my windows was stunning, as I looked out I could see the beautiful Grant Park. The room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting. The bed was very comfortable. The wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips. THe hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca. Overall I thouroughly enjoyed my stay here. "
"I stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town. It was a little pricey, but definitely worth it! The staff was super friendly, the pool was clean and well-maintained, and they even had a really good veggie burger in the restaurant downstairs (I'm a vegetarian). Plus, I paid for a room with a lake view and it was gorgeous. I would definitely recommend. "
"We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close! What I didn't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. I can't remember when I got a better night's sleep. The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. We'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we're in town!"
"The Hilton Chicago is one of the best Hotels I have ever had the good fortune to lodge at in my entire life. It is an extremely luxirious hotel located on the "Cultural Michigan Avenue Mile", and it overlooks Grant Park, Lake Michigan, and Museum Campus. In addition to overlooking those wonderful sights, it's also located conveniently close to Chicago's convention center, McCormick Place Convention Center, as well as the business center, shopping and theatre. Furthermore, there are a myriad of attractions close to the hotel, such as Millenium Park, Buckingham Park, and the Sears Tower. The amenities offered by the Hilton Chicago hotel include 100% wireless Internet access in all guest rooms, 27" inch flat screen televisions, a Serenity Bed, and two-line direct dial phones. And on top of all that, the hotel is pet friendly! I'll definitely be staying here again."
"The Hilton Hotel helped us make the most of our trip to Chicago. Not only are they centrally located near most of Chi towns hot spots, but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. The Hilton is very classy with their accommodations. I will be returning at my earliest convenience, be it for business or pleasure."
"This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago. It is ideal for the corporate executive. Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean. The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience. While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city, which is picturesque especially at night, when the city lights come on. The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area. I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive!"
"The stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation. Sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home! The accommodations and hotel are beautiful. I especially enjoyed the gym. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home."
"Last week I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for 4 days and 3 nights and I was very pleased with the experience. As soon as I approached the front desk, I knew right away the staff was friendly and courteous. They had given me a list of local attractions such as the Museum of Science and Industry, the Broadcast Museum, the Ford Center For The Performing Arts and Willis Tower. I stayed in a junior suite which included a king size bed, a 27 inch television, non-allergenic feather pillows and a variety of other amenities. The indoor pool was rather large as well as the gym which includes countless treadmills and even a jogging track. Eating in the area is not a problem as the Hilton Chicago is home to Kitty O'Sheas which is a restaurant offering authentic Irish fare. In conclusion, I had a wonderful time staying here and I can not wait to plan my return trip to the Hilton Chicago."
"Our stay at the Hilton Chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure. The staff was super friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and the location was fantastic. The walking track was an especially nice touch. Highly recommended!"
"great hotel. went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time. The hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at. Beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery. Great staff and wonderfull food as well, i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work."
"My family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city. We wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices. I can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton. The staff treated us well, the rooms were clean and roomy (we loved the Serenity beds), and the hotel itself is stunning. It was like stepping back in time. We loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions. The weather was lovely, so it was great to walk to Navy Pier, Sears Tower, and the Adler Planetarium. We will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago."
"The Hilton in Chicago was awesome. The room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional. One of the features I liked, was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless, considering my laptop is not wireless, it help me out alot. Food was very good, quality was great. There was also a flat screen in my room...awesome. The hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning. I also enjoyed the gym very much. Overall, I enjoyed myself, and I will stay again at the Hilton when I return to Chicago."
"Me and my wife recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while on vacation, and I can't recommend it enough. The hotel is located right on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago, and right next to tons of great restaurants and stores. The rooms are spacious and elegant; they are modern and stylish without being crazy or garish. I especially liked the big flat screen TV and the very comfy bed, sleeping in hotel rooms is often far from relaxing but I had no problem falling asleep. I highly recommend the Hilton Chicago, I'll definitely stay there again. A+ "
"My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown Chicago and do all the touristy things; shop the Magnificient Mile, see Shedd aquarium, go to the museum of Science and Industry. Homewood Suites was conveniently located near all of these things. It was a luxurious treat of a weekend! We even swam in their rooftop indoor pool. It was also nice to have the amenities of a suite, so we could prepare our own meals some days. The staff was friendly and courteous (they even gave me an extra pillow on request!) and we would definitely stay there again."
"Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown is a wonderful hotel. The hotel is very elegant, classy and only offers the best. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast, along with delicious meals and wines in the afternoons. The suites are very real designed and has a very upscale look. This wonderfully cozy yet graceful hotel leaves you with an experience of a lifeltime. I would recommend this awesome hotel to anyone that was looking for beautiful, yet comfortable hotel experience."
"If you want the downtown experience of a lifetime, with historical living that will bring you back to Chicago in the early 1900's look no further, the dining experience is as comfortable as the stay, service is immaculate, and just as you think things couldn't get any better, you are only a walk away from one of the most exciting cities in America: Chicago with fine dining and a late night rendezvous as exciting as the nightlife, you are sure to have your excitement whims met, and walk away with the memory of a lifetime. Believe me I did. Valued Customer, Josh"
"This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses. We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers. They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner. The fitness center was very clean, I didn't want to leave it! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery. Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago!"
"Very nice hotel, better than expected. The hot breakfast is great in the morning, but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond (even free wine!) The rooms are pretty good size, well furnished, and clean. I liked the view from my room. I used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked, was adequate. I will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view. The staff was friendly and helpful; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration. I would definitely recommend this hotel. "
"From the moment I walked in I was impressed. The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was welcoming. The hotel was spacious and glamorous without looking overindulgent. My room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything I would need was in my kitchen. I found the pool and gym to be fantastic and I could truly relax during my stay. I will definitely book another stay at this hotel. "
"To whom this may concern, my name is Jamie Brown, and i was a recent guest of yours between July 4th through July 10th, and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave. The Kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine, helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to. The free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well. I really couldn't have asked for anything more! I felt like a queen and I never though I could feel that way just staying in a hotel. I thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and I will gladly be visiting you again very soon, only for more pleasure and way less business. Sincerely yours, Jamie Brown "
"I would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are. For my wife and I, we enjoy the warmer colors. Cleanliness along with excellent staff, made me feel away from home yet relaxed. Being right Downtown was perfect for location. The suites are very quiet as well. I surprised my wife with the "Shopping Package". What a hit! Thanks Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown !!"
"My stay at the Hilton was like living in luxury for a few days. I never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel. During my stay I could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge. In fact, they didn't charge for WIFI, morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service. The lobby always had complimentary coffee, tea, soda and meals! I felt like a queen. This hotel deserves highest marks for service. "
"Upon entering Homewood Suites, I was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel. When I saw my room, I was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay (refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishwasher, flat panel TV). Best of all, the hotel has an on-site fitness center where I was able to work off all of the extra calories I consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast. I couldn't resist their omelettes! The hotel is in the heart of Chicago and I must say, the city view from my room was priceless. Definitely recommended! "
"I work for a software marketing firm, and that job requires me to travel at least 100 days per year. I spend a large amount of time in hotels. I normally don't write reviews for hotels, but the Homewood Suites by Hilton were above and beyond. Let's start where it matters: the rooms. They are top notch. There's nothing better than walking in to a clean, beautiful rooms after a long day of travel. The beds are among the best I've ever slept in in hotels. The rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home. The price: Low. I looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels, and everything else was at least 10% more expensive. But you don't get what you pay for here. You get much more than that! The location: Couldn't be better. You want to go to a world class restaurant? That's within walking distance. You want a great shopping experience? Again, walking distance. Anything else you want? Chances are, it's within walking distance. Overall, one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in."
"The Homewood Suites by Hilton, in downtown Chicago, has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city. After asking the doorman, I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen. The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take, as did the stove and LCD televisions. This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago. It's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $40 a night, which is what I payed when I stayed there in September. The atmosphere was warm and cozy, and the staff were all very friendly and professional."
"My stay at the Homewood Suites was absolutely one of my greatest stays away from home. The locations right in the heart of downtown Chicago. Within the River north shopping district.I love to shop so that was what i needed. Magnificent 2 room layouts with kitchen. The room was fully equipted with anything I needed,nice Flat screen along with a breakfast buffet and a fantastic complimentary dinner and wine. After dinner and wine I enjoyed the comfort of the heated indoor pool so relaxing. I would recommend these suites to everyone I know. "
"First of all when you check in the check in process is smooth and takes no time at all, the front desk is very friendly and kind and make sure you know where your room is. Then on the way to your room they have spots with chairs and a table to have a seat and visit with other guest if you prefer to be out of you room. The room it's self is very spacious and clean. The pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel, they never seemed to run out. The service is beyond exceptional. I would recommend staying at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown to anyone."
"Home away from home! The suites are amazing with great views of the city. The food is delious and served by an excellent staff. I loved the heated pool on the top floor, very relaxing after a long day of meetings. Great place to stay when your in Chicago!"
"Downtown Chicago has a multitude of available hotels. However once youve decided to step away from the ordinary a fantastic way to get away from it all is by booking a stay at the Homewood suites. The combination of luxury and affordability is evident as soon as youve entered the glamourous lobby. The Downtown Homewood suites is located near all the attractions which make Chicago the diverse and culturally rich town that is world known. The hotel offers a free fitness center, high speed wireless internet as well as a complimentary buffet breakfast. Being a member of the Hilton family ensures the utmost in quality and service which has been observed by millions of customers around the world. "
"The Homewood Suites is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago! It is a great place to stay as a family. The last time my family and I visited Chicago, we stayed and picked the Shedd Aquarium package. What an amazing time! The Aquarium is great, and we saved a lot of money by buying this package. I also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen. With two really picky children, it was so nice to be able to cook, or at least to have the option. We also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown. Nice pool, great workout room, breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I visit the Windy City!"
"I travel often and whenever I travel I prefer to stay at Hilton properties. I am always satisfied with my stay at Hilton. locations. However, I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites location. This property was awesome and it was great to have the same satisfication when I arrived. The lobby area was excellent and the greeting from the front desk staff was wonderful! My room was in great condition! Absolutely no complaints. I just figured that a property like this should be recognized. Great job staff!!!! I will definitely return in the future!"
"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The separated living room and bedroom made it feel like I was renting a nice furnished apartment instead of a hotel room. The kitchen was a comfort since I could prepare a meal for myself if I wished, and the refrigerator and microwave was a must since I never finish my meals when I go out to eat. I felt more at ease here rather than the detatched feeling I have with most hotels. I would recommend staying at this hotel if you want to feel comfortable and welcome in a sophisticated atmosphere."
"As a frequent traveler for both business and pleasure, clean and comfortable accommodations at a reasonable price are important to me. Homewood Suites Chicago provides all of that and more! The room was spacious and immaculately kept, with all the tools you could need to prepare a meal in the full-sized kitchen. After a busy work day, it was wonderful to be able to kick back in front of the huge flat-screen television to relax, with a spectacular backdrop of the city outside. I will definitely book a room next time in Chicago and I'll definitely continue to stay at Homewood Suites in other cities. "
"My experience at the Hyatt Regency Chicago was simply amazing. I had a wonderful stay there will my husband. My husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go, and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there. They were able to provide us with a Hyatt allergy-friendly room. We were so relieved and the room was beautiful. The furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil. It was the most comfortable stay we have ever had. On top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business, so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient. We took full advantage of the 24 hour room service. I will definitely stay there again. It is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room. "
"The Hyatt Regency in Chicago was a wonderful experience for my husband and I as we traveled through the area on vacation. After checking in we simply relaxed in the beautiful atrium for a while before going to our room. To our delight the room was very clean, ultra-modern and furnished with sleek and comfortable furniture. What really impressed us about the room was how spacious it was and the stunning river front views. We were pressed for time to make dinner so decided the Bistro sounded like the best option and it turned out to be a great choice! The food was simply fabulous. After dinner we were able to try out the fitness center, which ended up making our gym at home seem inadequate. This was just what we needed as a restful base for our Chicago vacation and we will definitely stay here again."
"The Hyatt Regency Chicago is a wonderful hotel. :) Me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation, and it couldn't have been better! The staff was very polite and helpful, and the rooms were very clean, and they had some of the best beds I've ever slept on! Not to mention the view was amazing! If I had to rate this hotel I'd definitely give it five star, next time I'm in town I will most definitely stay there again!"
"My girlfriends and I stayed at the Hyatt in Chicago during a shopping trip to the city in June 2010. We found a great deal on Orbitz.com and decided to give it a try. The location was perfect, just off Michigan Avenue,on the Chicago River, so it was easy to walk down the Mag Mile and get to all of the shops without having to pay for cabs or rent a car. The hotel is right next the The Palm restaurant, and within walking distance of several places to eat, both fancy (China Grill, yum!)and affordable (Corner Bakery). The rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious. We were lucky to get a room with a good view...be sure to ask that you do not have a view of the office building next door! The lobby is typical Hyatt, big and spacious with lots of plants. Service was good. All around an excellent experience and a great deal."
"The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel is perfecty located in the center of downtown Chicago. Whether you are going there for business or pleasure, it is in the perfect place. The rooms are large and beautiful and the ball room took my breath away. The wi-fi connection was perfect for the work I needed to do and the show at the Navy Pier was perfect for when I needed a break. Other hotels have nothing on the Hyatt. I just wish there was a Hyatt Regency in every city for all of my business trips."
"The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel was a delight to stay at. I've never been to Chicago before, but the location was fantastic. They had all sorts of different rooms, from non-smoking to smoking to hypo-allergenic rooms. I've never seen so many options for rooms. The room I stayed in was well worth the nightly price. The location was so close to all the activities my husband and I had planned for our vacation. We have never been treated so much like royalty than at the Chicago Hyatt Regency."
"From the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me. Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly. I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room, which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight, and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago. After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant. Overall my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit. "
"Overall, the hotel is beautiful. The service was great. All the employees were friendly and always willing to help. My room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River. The bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing. The only downfalls were parking and the fitness room. Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be. The hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms, so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located. "
"Quite simply the Hyatt Regency Chicago is the business traveler's best friend. Recently I had to attend a seminar in Chicago and stayed at the Hyatt. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. Centrally located in the heart of downtown, the Hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction. On arrival the staff goes into overdrive. They make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel. The rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens. My room came equipped with flat screen tv, wi-fi and high speed internet. Room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you. There were also car rental on site as were restaurants, cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room. They have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features. There is also catering and limo service. The staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional. All in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between. This hotel is definitely worth the price and I will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered. My only regret? That I could not stay much longer. "
"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago. My stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff. I needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy. The bed was so nice and soft! Even the pillows were fluffy. I was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe. The local restaurants were amazing. I will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future."
"I never thought I'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. I am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. I have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. So when my sister was getting married in Chicago, I was extremely anxious. The front desk associate, Rosa, was wonderful. She told me that they have Allergy friendly rooms. No perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded "industry standard" feather pillows. I booked a room, but was still really worried. I shouldn't have been. Ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. Maybe even a little better. They had an air purification system for our room. It smelled so fresh! While my husband took our daughter to the Big Bar for Nachos (she never stopped talking about how "totally cool" it was), I ordered room service for my son. The man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. My son has a lot of food allergies, so I was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. That's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. I was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. The only problem with my stay is that it was too short. We're coming back for our first family vacation since Ethan was born. Thank you, Hyatt Regency Chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!"
"My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary. We could not have picked a better locate. The price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget. The flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine. My husband loved the Stetson Steakhouse and the 24 hour stay fit gym. We really did not leave the hotel during I stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away. If we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay. This hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and I. What a wonderful ten years celebration."
"My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency while attending a family wedding in Chicago. From the moment we entered the beautiful lobby we were treated as if we were returning friends. Our rooms were ready upon arrival, and they were just as impressive as when I viewed them online. The location couldn't be more convenient to access all of Chicago's shopping and dining areas. We dined in Seston's Chop House, which I highly recommend. The staff at the hotel are professionals who work to make your stay there a grand experience. The Hyatt Regency Chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the Windy City!"
"I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for business, but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it! The accommodations exceeded my expectations. My bed was very comfortable, the room was big enough, and the shower was so relaxing. I had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at J's express. The fitness center was clean, and inspiring. I will recommend this hotel to others while in the area. "
"Great hotel with beautiful scenery! The staff was wonderful and the rooms were comfortable and spacious. They even had a docking station for my iPod! "
"I went to Chicago on business last year and I had the pleasure of staying at the luxurious Hyatt Regency Hotel. I opted for the Business Plan, although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from, such as the Allergy Friendly, Monarch Suite, State Suite, all the way up to the Presidential Suite. My suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort, equipped with Wi-Fi, a generous 37 inch television, spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body. I dined at the Stetson's Chop Shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared. The staff was curtious and accommodating. For breakfast, I opted to have my meal brought to my room where I started my business day over a delicious hot meal and strong, gourmet coffee. I would highly recommend this wonderful haven to anyone planning an overnight Chicago stay."
"Great hotel!! The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was in perfect shape, very clean and just a beautiful setup. I will definetly go to this hotel many more times when i am in the area! I would definetly recommend it!"
"The Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel offered PDA or kiosk check-in which was great. They also offer hypo-allergenic rooms with air purification systems which gave us a much more delightful stay. We enjoyed the 24/7 stay fit gym, iHome stereo with iPod docking station, flat screen tv with video on demand and Wi-Fi. Concierge staff was very helpful with assisting us with finding excellent award winning dining and popular attractions in the area. We enjoyed our stay and will definetly return to this hotel in the future for family and business trips."
"The Hyatt Regency Chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that I have ever stayed at. I stayed there for 3 days and two nights. My room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully. The staff was very kind and very helpful. The concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in Chicago. Overall, A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city."
"Recently, I traveled to Chicago for a business conference and was lucky enough to stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. The whole experience was wonderful! The room was spacious and beautiful, and the bed was so comfortable that I had no problem falling asleep, as I normally do at other hotels. The staff were polite and courteous, and after a delicious breakfast in the restaurant, I went to my conference with a smile on my face."
"Recently I traveled to Chicago for business. I was treated to a stay at the InterContinental Chicago by my employer. It truly says something about your company when they are willing to go the extra mile to make time away from family and friends as comfortable and as relaxing as possible for you. I was greeted by a series of smiling faces that were employed at the hotel and all were eager to help. I checked in at the amazingly lavish lobby and was escorted by hotel staff who assisted me with my bags up to my room. My room was dripping with taste. The stylish room was only made more accommodating by the amenities it offered. With a mini-bar, large flat-screen television, and an entire home office setup, I barely had to leave the room. Why would I want to with the amazing views of the lake and entire city. What an amazing experience I had and I will gladly come back."
"At the InterContinental Chicago, you pay for more than a room. You pay for an experience. Let me elaborate. I was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. Like any novice traveller to Chicago, I saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what I set my sights on. Price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. But after doing a bit of research, I realised that distance does have its costs. The price of transit in the Chicagoland area isn't free. And it's far from what I'm used to. Car use is price prohibitive. (I knew that originally, which is why I wasn't going to drive.) But the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. So, I ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. But mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. That's what originally drew me to InterContinental. But InterContinental is much more than the right room at the right place. The decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. I was travelling on international business, so the ease with which I could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (They had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) And the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. My work gets me tied up in knots. It also leaves little time for doing chores. So the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. But, on top of all that, the event planning was what put InterContinental over the top. Being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of Chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something I won't forget. In the end, if you're a newcomer to Chicago staying in a time-crunch, the InterContinental is for you. The pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. And the InterContinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be."
"Last month, my husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago while we were in town for IMTS. Although they were very busy, the service was excellent and very professional. The staff were always smiling and happy to help. InterContinental was conveniently located near Michigan avenue, and the best stores and restaurants in town. The view from our room was great! Our room was always clean when we arrived home at night, it was decorated nicely, and the beds were extremely comfortable! We ate at the hotel's restaurant Zest, and the food was great! It was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while. We will definitely be back!"
"My husband and I visited this hotel on our way home from our honeymoon. It's a very nice hotel, but the valet parking is very expensive, $53.00 per night was rather high so we opted to park our own car. The pool was very nice, and the water was warm. The front desk was very nice and helpful, If I ever visited Chicago again I would stay there."
"The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy. The room had a great view of a lake. Room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee. There was a business center that had internet, fax machines, and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day. One of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs, it was exactly what I needed, very relaxing. The food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate, I never wanted to leave. This was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again."
"The Inter Continental is a great hotel. The staff was very friendly, and the accomidations were great. The room was clean and ready on time, and the indoor swimming pool was perfect considering Chicago's weather. Eno was simply AMAZING. Their wine selection is second to none. And the Turkey Pumpkin Curry at Zest was to die for."
"The InterContinental hotel is truly a hidden treasure. Nestled deep in sky scraping steel epicenter of downtown Chicago, the hotel is a taste of both modern day luxury and old time charm. From the tiled indoor pool surrounded by high Romanesque arching ceilings to the rich mahogany furniture and lace curtains in the suites, the InterContinental was built to satisfy the taste of even the most hardened traveler. Book well in advance as it is one of the most sought after retreats in all of Chicago."
"This is a review of a first class hotel the InterContinental Chicago. It's located on Chicago's famous magnificent mile near restaurants, shopping, entertainment, and historic landmarks. The service at the hotel is first class and the accommodations are unbeatable. The hotel also features really fabulous amenities including a nice indoor swimming pool, fine dining, a 24 hour business center, and valet parking. This is a extra ordinary luxury hotel that will make your stay in Chicago a joy. They offer a number of options on the rate and have a selection of package deals available. Visit their website for a photo gallery and a virtual tour. "
"I am so glad I decided to stay at the Intercontinental Chicago for my first trip to the city. The staff is very attentive, I felt like I was the only person they had to take care of! The location is great, right on the Magnificent Mile and so close to major attractions. My suite was well appointed and very clean. I even looked behind some furniture for dust and couldn't find any. The hotel is very luxurious. The sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable. The next time I travel to Chicago, I will definitely stay at the Intercontinental again."
" We just returned from a relaxing stay at the InterContinental in Chicago. I have to say the service was phenomenal! From the maid to the concierge and everyone in between, the staff treated us like royalty. It was quite the treat to feel so special. Our room was gorgeous. The view of the city was breathtaking. The luxury mattress and bedding made for the most comfortable peaceful slumber. We found the marble bathroom stunning and impeccably clean. My wife was very pleased with the lighted make-up mirror while I enjoyed the reliable Wi-Fi connection. During our stay we dinned in the Zest. Wow! They offer an extensive wine menu and a full array of gourmet food options. We had to try the famous wiener schnitzel -- it was scrumptious. Afterwards, my wife and I shared the chocolate lava cake, can I just say oh that cake is to die for! Really the best we ever had. In the morning we spent some time working off dinner at the junior olympic swimming pool; followed by an exhilarating round of cardio in the hotels dedicated cardio room. Afterwards, a trip to the sauna was a well deserved refuge. Overall, our stay at the InterContinental in Chicago was nothing short of fabulous. This luxury hotel is complete with the finest of amenities and the most caring staff. We are looking forward to staying at the InterContinental again, hopeful soon! "
"This is a great place to stay while visiting Chicago. My husband and I went over the holidays to see my family and we stayed at this hotel. We could not have asked for nicer people! Everyone was always smiling and very helpfull! We usually stay at the Ramada...but will never stay anywhere other than the InterContinental Chicago hotel again! - Casey L. Skinner"
"Wow! I have been to many hotels as a business man, and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels. But wow, this hotel was great. The staff was prompt, the room was extremely clean, and everything just ran like a well-oiled machine. I was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things. Usually I have to pay 5$ for a stupid toothbrush, but not here! I really enjoyed staying at InterContintental. I was very worried about the Chicago area's reputation of bad hotels, but this turned out just great. Next time my boss flies me out to Chicago, I know where I am staying! "
"This hotel is in a great city with great personnel working there. The rooms are more than you can expect for a hotel. The services are abundant, leaving no room to complain. With their fine diners, you cannot go wrong with enjoying a peaceful meal while relaxing. With this hotel, it is truly an all-in-one hotel. There are meeting rooms and business centers, leaving unfinished work not be a worry during the stay. In addition, the spacious swimming pool is just the thing needed to relieve yourself of stress. The views from the rooms are breathtaking. I would definitely recommend staying there!"
"Very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view. The dinning selection is one of the best I have seen in Chicago. I have stayed many places downtown Chicago and nothing matches this. I am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well. The shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors. The biggest thing that I have to say is that the Customer service was great with everything that I needed. I give the hotel a 5 out of 5."
"The InterContinental Chicago is located in the heart of Downtown Chicago, Illinois on North Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile. This hotel is located within moments, not minutes, from the Navy Pier, Millennium Park, and Magnificent Mile Shopping. The InterContinental Chicago boasts a modern fitness center that feature free weights, a cardio room, dry saunas, as well as, masseurs. When business knocks at your door, the hotel has a 24 hour business center providing high-speed internet access, fax, and photocopying services. The accommodations at the InterContinental Chicago are elegant with a touch of historic decor. The room had a breath-taking view of Chicago, as well as, had an in-room mini-bar, terry-cloth bath robes, over-sized desks, high-speed internet access, and a 37-inch Hi Def LCD Television. Not only was the overall quality of the property in stunning condition, the staff at the InterContinental Chicago were welcoming, caring, and demonstrated a profound customer-service base."
"The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is absolutely magnificent. The rooms are of utmost standard and you get treated with such respect. The staff is always there no matter what. Not only is the hotel beautiful but it surrounded by beautiful lights and beautiful skyscrapers. I give it two dumbs up. If you are ever in Chicago the InterContinental Chicago is the place to stay."
"The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is one of the finest hotels I have stayed at in a long time. The atmosphere upon arrival was one of elegance and beauty. The staff welcomed us and catered to our every need. The rooms were plush and very romantic. Interior decor was breathtaking. It is definitely above a 4 star rating and I would not think twice about coming back here. It received my highest recommendation."
"This hotel is absolutely beautiful. I is elegant, comfortable and a very relaxing stay. It was easy to get to the airport and very close to shopping. I felt like a king in a castle surrounded by luxury and beauty. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. "
"My family's seven day stay at the InterContinental Chicago hotel was more than I could ever imagine. The InterContinental is more fantastic than any previous hotel I have visited, because of its wonderful amenities, such as the excellent 24 hour room service, access to personal trainers,and even a dry cleaning service, just to mention a few. My family really enjoyed dining on the contemporary American cuisine at the hotels Zest Restaurant, which served an excellent meal worth every dime of its reasonable price. My most favorite point about the InterContinental Chicago is that it provides entry right into the Windy City, where my family and I had immediate access to transportation, shopping, and city attractions. We had a great time traveling through Chicago and enjoying ourselves while at the same time we felt secure knowing that we had a nice, clean, elegant, safe hotel to travel back to whenever we were done touring the city each day. The InterContinental is a must stay and I will recommend them to anyone who plans on visiting Chicago."
"I was going to Chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops. I did some research and believed the InterContinental would suit my needs. I sure was not disappointed by my decision! This hotel lots of historic charm. Despite being a larger hotel, the service was top shelf! The rooms, while not large by any means, were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable. My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered. As for me, I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile. The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site. The food was very good and, just like the hotel itself, the restaurant provided perfect customer service. Dollar for dollar, the InterContinental in Chicago is a great deal and I will be staying there again. "
"Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. I chose it largely for location as I don't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. It was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food, of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. Our room was amazing. Seriously amazing. It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed. There wasn't one little spot of dust to be found. The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. We didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. We had dinner at David Burke's Primehouse. I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly. It was fantastic. For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. I've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home. I'm sad to say that I didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit. The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable. The staff was friendly, the hotel beautiful, and the food delicious. What more could you want?"
"I've stayed at several different hotels in Chicago but The James is the best. Everything I need is in walking distance and I find it very convenient to stay there. The staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly. The room has always been very clean. The bed linens are better that the nice sheets I have on my own bed. Thankfully I don't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I've found my favorite."
"This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. I went there to see about scheduling my reception party, and was amazed at the architecture of the building, the interior design of the rooms, and the massive spacing provided for each room. Now I recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the James Club, so that after the meetings, we can partake in a nice meal and drinks. Which brings me to my next point. The James has some of the BEST food I have ever eaten!!! The James Private Club, I feel was made for the elite and upper class. Very classy, very elegant. The customer service is outstanding. I recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception, business meeting, or just need to have a day at the spa. 5 stars all the way!!! "
"I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter. The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me. Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services. Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I'd been in years. My room was clean and modern, yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding. I'll certainly be staying with them again in the future. "
"We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids. We reserved the "Family Adventurer with Paul Frank". It's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium. We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes, which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children's Museum. My kids had a ball. We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored. All in all, a great weekend where my kids were the focus. The adults certainly weren't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning. "
"My stay at the James Hotel in Chicago was fantastic! The hotel was clean, modern and everything I had hoped for. The staff was fabulous and went above and beyond all of our expectations. All of our needs were more than met and I will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates."
"Do you want to stay in a sleek modern hotel that gives you all of the amenities to conduct your business? Then the James Hotel in Chicago is the place for you. Superb clean lines and sophistication welcomes you on first sight. Followed by spacious rooms, luxurious linens, and all-natural Kiehl's body shampoos and lotions. I absolutely loved my stay at the James Hotel in downtown Chicago. The bathrooms have raised sinks, and all of the luxurious amenities you would want. I absolutely loved the natural wood feel mingled with a modern touch. I felt at home in a very clean and modern atmosphere. I definitely would stay again, and plan to stay at the James in New York as well "
"This was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. For this week's vacation in Chicago, I heard several recommendations regarding lodging, but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. I expected an experience of comfort, luxury and customer satisfaction, but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. The design is breathtaking -- modern, clean, stylish, sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby, shops and restaurants, to the stunning guest rooms themselves. My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in, and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. Far from a traditional hotel experience, this was like moving into chic, exclusive downtown apartment, and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. Impressive, too, was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources. From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage, the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world, and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. It's a respect that shows through, too, in other areas: support for artistic organizations, charities and other programs of merit, as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay, whether for a weekend, a week, or longer. The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. In fact, we may visit again solely to stay at the James! "
"Just what I needed at James: I can't tell you how impressed I was with my stay at the James Chicago Hotel. I came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend. The crisp, clean, contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work. It was luxury without being over the top. My room was clean, comfortable and was above all standards comfortable. In my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the "JBar", and I highly recommend dinner at the "David Burke Primehouse" The customer service from all the staff members, from front desk, to house keeping to the bartender was excellent. I plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience. "
"I had a wonderful time at the James Hotel while on business in Chicago. The rooms are modern, tasteful and well-kept, while the staff was responsive and efficient. This was the perfect place to unwind after working all day, but also provided an ideal atmosphere to do some more work. "
"Recently my husband and I stayed at The James in Chicago for our "night on the town". After taking in a musical, we checked in at The James and were happily surprised with the customer appreciation and delicious room service. The rooms were spotless and we were supplied with fresh towels for everything from showers to the spa to visiting the gym. If I had known that they accepted pets beforehand, it would've been a great environment for our family lapdog. Staying at The James in Chicago made our night a luxurious outing and will be a definite stop next time we are in Chicago."
"I am often traveling on business and I always try to stay at the James. The modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined, comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment. The availability of computers and coffee in the James' business centers means I do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel. The James provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings. The ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that I do not have to stress or rush, as my time is valuable. I love the James."
"The James Chicago Hotel is located right in the heart of the one and only, downtown Chicago. This wonderful hotel has many classy and down to earth boutique's, and the views are breath-taking. The hotel just has a warm feeling to it, and the hotel staff is more than excellent. This hotel is situated right across from the Magnificent Mile, and only minutes away from the world famous shopping, dining, and fun for all ages. The James is modern and luxurious. The James is definately a hotel that I would recommend and will go back to in years to come. "
"Our stay at the James in late last August exceeded our expectations. My husband was in Chicago for a business trip, and I tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life. When we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors, and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly. He met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions. The lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive. Our room was also very clean. I could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. The bed was comfortable, and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in. It has been awhile since I have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin. My husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month. The bathroom was also impressive. The water pressure was not something I had to mess with to get perfect, and the heater took no time at all to warm up. Even though I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner, I did give the amenities in the bathroom a try, and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. I did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms, however, my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities. I truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel, and if we are ever in the Chicago area again we will definitely be staying here. This hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure. "
"This hotel is great! I love its interior design of the room. Customer service is excellent! And its gym and spa are gorgeous. If you need to go to Chicago, this hotel would be your best choice! You can also check its website for the special offer, I found a great deal on it! "
"the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The room service is the best in the area, not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for. The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary. This is a great place to take the family to relax. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 5 stars! "
"This is a beautiful hotel inside and outside. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The hotel made my experience of visiting this city even more wonderful, I highly recommend this to anyone. "
"My husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel for our anniversary. This place is fantastic! We knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice! The rooms are BEAUTIFUL and the staff very attentive and wonderful!! The area of the hotel is great, since I love to shop I couldn't ask for more!! We will definatly be back to Chicago and we will for sure be back to the James Chicago. Betsy M, Louisville, KY "
"We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much. The hotel is elegant and uber-modern! Each room simply exudes class. I have never stayed in a nicer hotel, to be honest. The hotel features an upscale restaurant, though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments. There is also a full-service spa at the hotel. The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed; our dog didn't have to stay at home. How cool is that? There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking, 24-hour room service, 24-hour concierge, shoe shine service, and laundry/dry cleaning. The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile, so that location is absolutely superb. You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world. I would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago. "
"Great hotel! Went to see the Museum of Contemporary Art which was great, but this hotel almost had it beat! The rooms (and even halls) are very beautifully done. Great service too. A+"
"My company was hosting a seminar at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago, IL. Each participant of the seminar stayed in one of the luxurious rooms at the hotel. My room had an incredible view of downtown Chicago and the styles of the rooms were very modern. My husband was able to stay back in the room and enjoy the large flat screen television while I attended the seminar in one of the hotels meeting rooms. On Saturday night, my company held a ball in the Crystal Ballroom. The food was excellent, the hotel chefs were the best. The servers were polite and were right there to fill up our drinks or bring us more food at the dinner. Our overall stay at Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel will be forever in my memory. It was a fun filled weekend with great food, clean rooms, excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want! We will definitely be staying here again! "
"It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say, i'd definitely go back, not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed, but most importantly, because of the hotel that we stayed in. The Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests, but with pets too. At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog, but I was surprised it turned out the other way. I've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that's really frustrating, it's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago. "
"I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a fun weekend in Chicago. The standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable. I love a hotel with all white sheets because then I know it's clean. I really liked the simple and modern decor, especially the huge upholstered headboard. Nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter. The bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home. The staff was friendly. Can't really judge the service because I didn't have any problems or complaints. So I didn't have a reason to interact with the staff much. Overall, it was a very nice hotel in a great location. Will definitely stay here again on my next visit."
"This hotel was incredible! Haven't had a better stay in a hotel in my life. I will definitely come here again next time I am in Chicago! The rooms were so elegant, with their modern color schemes. The staff members were friendly and willing to lend a hand. The beds were surprisingly comfortable, with interesting covers. The TVs were HD, which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before. There was a cool martini bar that I spent an hour at one night, which was enjoyable, especially because of the live jazz band"
"I stayed here in the last weekend of September 2010 for the Bears vs Packers Monday Night game. My room rocked! I had a pretty big flat screen, and a super soft bed. The room was clean and stylish, and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out. My favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home. I definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax."
"I just spent a week at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel and it was a very plesant stay. When I first walked into the room it was very clean. The bathroom was a decent size and the decorum was pleasant. Room service was very good. The view was amazing and I would recomend staying there."
"I wouldn't know how to begin to write something negative about the Millenium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago. Everything about this hotel is fantastic from the outside of the building to the hotel lobby all the way to the rooms. With very clean and plush rooms, this is the place to stay! When you are not at the hotel eating at the elegant dining area or having a great breakfast first thing in the morning, there is plenty to do around the town. Take a shopping spree down Michigan Ave or head to one of the museums or the pier to look around. Whatever you decide to do, you can't go wrong. This place is wonderful!"
"I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a total of three days, and through out my stay I had a wonderful time. The room was impeccably clean, as well as the pillows and sheets. The beds were large and extremely comfortable. The staff though, in my honest opinion, is what made my stay so pleasant. From the people at the check in, to the waiters at the restaurant, I got the best customer service. The hotel was also conveniently located. It was within walking distance to the shopping center. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in Chicago. "
"This hotel was worth every cent. You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here. In town for a conference, my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything. Fine dining, entertainment, you name it: Knickerbocker's got it! I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family."
"First let me say wonderful!! My wife and i were refered this Hotel by a friend. After traveling to Chicago many time we have had many experiences good and bad with different hotels. We were amazed with the Knickerbocker, we felt like royalty from our first step on the property. Everyone was willing to make our stay rememberable. This Hotel made a routine trip to Chicago a dream Vacation. I can not wait to return..."
"The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit. My wife and I utilized the park & play package, which gave us an amazing room, complimentary valet service, and a great kit to plan our weekend around. It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again. The rooms were top notch and the hotel's staff was excellent. One of the employees, Craig, helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests. We loved our visit and are sure you will too. A+"
"We stayed at the beautiful Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel located in scenic downtown Chicago. It was close to shopping, local attractions like the Shedd Aquarium and even the Navy Pier. The hotels featured luxurious amenities like a ball room and in room massages, which I took advantage of as any woman (or man) should! A continental breakfast is available for a nominal fee, unless purchased with a package deal, in their own upscale restaurant, Nix! We would definitely book a suite there again and highly recommend this hotel to all our friends and family!"
"I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel. The place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm! Also, there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance, so I shopped while my husband worked. It just doesn't get any better than that! I loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel, and I'd definitely stay there again!"
"When you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered. The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can. The check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected. When you enter your room the decor catches your eye. Luxurious yet not stuffy is how I describe it. The restroom tub is large and made of marble. The whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home. I highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while."
"This hotel is the best hotel ever in my opinion, and I really enjoy everything thing about it and I also have many different reasons why I like this hotel. From the entrance to every details on the inside all the way up to the rooms, everything seems to pocess some kind of style to it and not forgetting such a modern feel it has. I completely am astonished by this building and if I had to pick one to compare with this one I really would go for this one. It's like a person would have to see it to believe. It has a lot of modern designs. Thank you and this is my review and it's real. "
"I enjoyed a pleasant 2 night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago, Il. The hotel was beautiful, inside and out. I felt as if I was a celebrity staying there. The staff was especially kind and very professional. My husband and I have never felt more comfortable. I was very pleased that they had transportation for us, since we flew in to Chicago for our anniversary. The Shedd Aquarium package was an excellent bonus. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone that's going to be visiting Chicago!"
"My family really enjoyed this hotel the weekend we were in Chicago. Check in was quick and easy the staff was friendly and very helpful. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable and we had a great view of Chicago. Next time we come to Chicago we will definitely stay here again."
"The entrance and room was spacious and modern, yet elegant. It was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of Chicago. The drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds. Indeed, it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots. "
"I stayed at the millennium Knickerbocker for 3 nights while on a business trip, as it was conveniently located a few blocks away from the office I was visiting, and just about everything else for that matter. The lobby was absolutely beautiful, and the staff was beyond courteous and extremely helpful. The rooms were elegant and spacious, and I instantly felt right at home. The large flat screen TV as a nice touch and TV options were many. I headed downstairs to the bar for a drink, and was amazed at how well kept it was, as well as how nice everybody was. As this was my first time I asked the bartender about the area around and he gave me great advice about some places to check out. All in all this was a great experience, and next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be staying here. I'd recommend the Millennium Knickerbocker to anyone traveling to Chicago."
"We stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful. First off, the staff is excellent. All of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile. The hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that Chicago has to offer. All of the shopping of Michigan Avenue was just steps from our room. We decided to go for the Shedd Aquarium package. We started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our "all access pass" to the aquarium (very cool!). After our long days of sightseeing (and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar), it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant, but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city. To top it all off, they have the most incredible shower that I've ever used (and, even better, it's all "green"). What more can I say? The Millennium Knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable. I highly recommend it!"
"Hotel Monaco is a luxurious hotel situated in the heart of Chicago. It is blooming with historical elegance combined with modern day amenities. I had the pleasant experience of staying at this facility. Perfectly set up to handle any business traveler, sight seer, convention, wedding or shopper. They offer top notch service from reservations to wedding planning or even asking for a good local restaurant. I noticed that world travelers are welcome here with some of the employees ability to speak foreign languages. Guest rooms offer stylish charm and can relax even the unrelaxable. In room spa's and top notch room service is second to none. The South Water Kitchen is a true downtown Chicago restaurant offering mid-west American dishes and several signature cocktails. I know that anytime I visit Chicago, Hotel Monaco is my place to be. "
"I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and I must say, it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. In the past, I've always stayed at the Marriott or the Hilton so this time I thought I'd go with a boutique hotel. I've stayed at some of the Kimpton properties in San Francisco so I was delighted that they are running the Monaco. Basically, I like the friendly, real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places I've used before. I do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill I normally use. South Water Kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. I really dug the complimentary coffee, high speed internet and newspaper. I get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the Monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. All in all, I will return to the Monaco. It's a great alternative."
"Hotel Monaco is simply amazing. I travel quite a bit, and am use to generic hotels, with horribly unimpressive rooms, and "5 star amenities" which usually mean a packet of instant coffee, and room service that won't serve after 9pm. Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive. The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. This hotel has such personality. My absolute favorite part of my stay, aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs, was the in-room spa treatment. Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. Generic just won't do anymore."
"You made Chicago a wonderful stay! The room was gorgeous! I came with very little on hand and my deluxe room supplied me with everything that I needed, I didn't even have to ask! Thank you so much, I will be back! Very tidy room as well!"
"I stayed at the monaco for the Labor day weekend when I visited my family in Chicago. It is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life. clean, comfortable and pretty. The rooms were clean and the staff is very caring. I needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink. The front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes. I will recommend Monaco to anyone who will be staying in the Chicago area. "
"I have heard friends talking about the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and did have my doubts at first. However when I arrived there was amazed at the location! It is near so many shopping places, museums, theatre, and many others places. Was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long, however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay. Fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day! The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people. One day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel. All and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room, good service, and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby, will be heading back to this hotel many times."
"The Hotel Monaco Chicago was a great hotel. The rooms were very nice, great customer service. Every member of the staff was extremely nice. I liked that it was pet friendly, and you couldn't even tell they allowed pets. Very clean. Prompt service when requested, and the food was very tasty! An A+ in my book, the prices were very reasonable as well since it is a four star hotel. Very immaculate. Will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Chicago."
"This is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Chicago River and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city! I had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service. If you're looking for a vacation in Chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort, I highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely come again!"
"This was a great hotel, one of the nicest that we have stayed in a long time. My wife was absolutely thrilled with the staff and we couldn't believe the KimptonKids program at the site. We will be back next time we stop in town. We cannot think of a better place to stay. "
"Fantastic stay! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference. Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm. Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door. They are the best I've ever had. EVER! If youre in the mood to unwind, you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. I had a great time here. From now on, I won't stay anyplace else. "
"Upon entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago, i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building. The old fashioned furnishings, the wonderful view, and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel. At first i had been skeptical, but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone. As i entered my room, the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me. During my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool, winding down every night with a comforting massage. I would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance, but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities. "
"This will be the only hotel I will never forget in my life. Hotel Monaco Chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice. Whether if it's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite, all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based, so it suits ones personality. Even if you are a super sized person, like me with a height of 6"4', there are special "Tall Rooms" just for you. My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel. Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. Before I go to a meeting, I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service. After I come back from the meeting, I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines. I just didn't want to leave that hotel; so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago, I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago."
"Our experience at Hotel Monaco was wonderful. My fiancee and I stayed two nights in the Tranquility suite--absolutely exquisite! We had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room. (Except to go to the gym :) I was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room! I was surprised by that. This hotel was the definition of 'luxury', they had anything we needed and more. My fiancee said we were staying at a really 'nice' hotel but I had no idea until we walked in the door. As soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor. I have to admit, cheesy as it may sound, I felt like a queen all weekend long :) Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at, but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago."
"My stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago was amazing. The staff are polite and well poised, eager to give a helping hand in a short notice. To someone like me, who had never even been in the city of Chicago, it really gave me a good feeling throughout my whole trip. The rooms, hallways and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy, and whenver I went out, I would always find my room perfect ; be it for a night of undwinding after one of my conferences, or just to hit the mattress and sleep. During my stay, I stopped at their restuarant where I had one of the best American style meal in a while. Overall, the Hotel Monaco is a place I would surely stay at again if given the chance to visit Chicago for a second time. It is truely exceptional."
"I went to Chicago and We made a reservation to Hotel Monaco Chicago which is a Kimpton Hotel, and I decided to stay in a tranquility suite. Which was amazing I went with my family and all of us had a comfortable space. Room Service Was great served quickly and the cleaners clean quick. Another thing was that it was pet friendly which I thought was cool meaning you could bring your dogs. The hotel was amazing and beutiful."
"I frequently have business meetings in Downtown Chicago and find that the Hotel Monaco Chicago, gives me the peace of mind to make those meetings enjoyable. While it might be more expensive than your average hotel....but there is nothing average in this hotel. Exceeds any expectations - service, food, quality, atmosphere were heads above anywhere. Thanks for making my trips to Chicago - the best of the best."
"Beautiful hotel in chicago. I visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife. They are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services. I would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago."
"As I walked into the hotel I was greeted warm heartedly. They took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly. I was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom. Also, I was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient. Overall, I was very happy with my stay at this hotel. "
"My stay at the Hotel Monaco recently was fantastic. We got a very reasonable price for our stay (especially since we were a AAA member), and there was plenty of perks to utilize; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few. Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that, upon request, the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room. How cool is that! The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area. "
"I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago! I was very pleasantly surprised, as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway, and he usually picks bad places-haha. Anyway, the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. It was busy and the line was a little long, but it moved quickly. The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good, especially since it seemed to be near full. The room was clean and spacious (especially considering it's a city hotel). We made a lot of use of the concierge, since again, it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans. He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy! It was also great being near the theater district, and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room! very trendy. My husband is not as easily impressed, but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. Overall, really nice stay in a four star, or probably four and half star hotel!"
"My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago on a mini vacation. We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in the downtown area. This hotel is simply beautiful. From the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left, we were treated as if we were royalty. I have never been treated so well. We were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs. We stayed in a Superior Corner Suite. The view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room didn't seem like we were in a hotel, it had the feeling of home. There was a separate living room area which was wonderful, my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline. It was mesmerizing. We ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping, which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping. Most everything is in walking distance. The food was to die for; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant. We did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge. The lounge had a classy feel to it, very relaxing yet sophisticated. We even received a massage, in our room. While we did have all the conveniences of home, such as internet and TV, we did not even think about using them, being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives. This was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken. I cannot express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel. We had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here. The rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience, which the experience itself is priceless. I will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel. "
"The Omni Chicago Hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever had the oppertunity to visit. Not only are the desk clerks very helpful, but you feel like a celebrity when you visit. The workout room is great with lots of room so you do not feel cramp. They also have a great indoor pool and a spa. It also comes with 2 sundecks to get a nice tan. If you need a vacation, this is the place to stay."
"The Omni Chicago Hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel, particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv's. The windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room, before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows, which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom. An in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay. There's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince. However, the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use, as well as the whirlpool, Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool. Sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks. A nice aspect that isn't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel. The Omni Chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation, particularly when you don't want to be separated from your pet, within the area. "
"I truly enjoyed my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. We stayed in a suite, which was clean and extremely nice, at a very reasonable rate. My husband and I spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool, but personally I preferred laying out on the sundeck. Service was excellent; they were friendly and all of our needs were met promptly. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great experience in the downtown Chicago area."
"I recently had my wedding at the Omni Hotel in Chicago and I was more than pleased. The decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one, I was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once I met with the staff at the Omni I was certain that it was the way to go. The staff was so attentive and friendly, and I felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel. I highly recommend the Omni Hotel in Chicago, brides will not be dissapointed!"
"The Omni Chicago Hotel is a very high quality hotel. This hotel is a very comfortal and high tech place to relax. It has everything you could possibly want to relax, workout, and feel luxurious. A must stay at hotel, I give it five stars."
"My husband and I stayed at the Omni after attending a wedding that took place there. We were delighted at the luxury of the rooms and the accomodations were wonderful. Everyone from the concierge to the housekeepers were friendly and professional. We were extremely pleased with the whole experience and look forward to our next trip to Chicago so we can stay there again. And, by the way, the wedding was absolutely gorgeous!"
"My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel last weekend and I felt compelled to write a review about this wonderful hotel. I have to say I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the beautiful decor of this hotel. Not to mention the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever encountered. I frequently stay at hotels for business but have never had such a wonderful experience as I did at the Omni Chicago Hotel. From the minute we walked in the beautiful front doors to the time of our check out we were absolutely treated like royalty. This is one hotel that I would definitely rate 5 stars. You can be sure, I will absolutely be back in the future."
"The Omni Chicago Hotel is amazing little get away right on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago. This hotel is warm and homey as well as modern and filled with amenities! The beds are very comfortable and there are flat screen televisions in the rooms (at least both times I have stayed). The Windy City Spa provides a relaxing getaway as well.The indoor pool provides something fun for all ages and the customer service was excellent. The garage was very secure and has unlimited in/out priviledges which made it nice to be able to access the car as much as you wanted without any penalty. All in all, well worth it and will plan to stay again!"
"I had to go down to Chicago one weekend for the graduation ceremony of my cousin. It was a sudden trip and I didn't even have the time to book a hotel before hand. When I showed up in Chicago and asked my taxi driver to take me to the nearest good hotel, he took me to Omni Chicago Hotel. I was impressed with how clean it was and they didn't have a problem with getting me a room even though I didn't have a reservation. The staff was friendly to me the entire time I was in the hotel, which was just a short two nights, and the cleaning service was top notch."
"My family and I vacation in Chicago and stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel. Upon our arrival we were greeted happily and the kids received FREE bagpacks for their stay which they loved. The staff was great and always greeted us as we walked in and out of the hotel. They even remembered our names! The location of the hotel was amazing, right on the Magnificent Mile. We really enjoyed our stay and the kids loved the indoor pool. I would definitely stay there again if I have the chance and would recommend it to anyone I know going to the Chicago area. "
"Me and my husband got married here. We loved the atmosphere of our suite. It felt like home away from home. They have a nice pool. The rooms were clean and the staff was courteous. Thanks so much for doing such a great job with our wedding. Amy C. of Los Angelas, California"
"The Omni Chicago is hands down, the best hotel in my opinion in the chicago area. I am a neat freak but here you need not worry about cleanliness as they are the best at keeping the rooms tidy. Our check in was easy and fast and the staff at the hotel was very courteous and friendly. I forgot my hair dryer but thankfully, one of the many perks at this hotel, they provide one for you in your room! That's a small benefit compared to the lucious pool and dreamy massages they offer! I have never had a massage like that before! My favortie thing about the Omni is the high speed wireless internet that is available to all guests. I am able to do my work online in all areas of the hotel which saved me a lot of time as I was not at my office but still had a lot of work to get done. I also LOVED the TV they provide in the room. A big plasma with a beautiful, crisp picture! I don't even have that at home! Needless to say, I spent almost all night lounging in the comfortable bed watching movies only to fall asleep and wake up to the newspaper delivered to my hotel door in the morning! I will be coming back to the Omni on my next trip to Chicago. That's a promise. "
"My stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel was wonderful! I had a last minute business trip, in downtown Chicago, and this is the first place I looked at. I looked at the pictures they show online of the rooms, and the facility itself, and I simply fell in love with the place. The indoor pool, outdoor sun decks, massages, this place really has all you could possibly need, whether you're on vacation, or needing a little stress relieved from a busy week. I mean they even have high speed wireless internet! I would definitely recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel, if you want a great place to stay near Downtown Chicago!"
"We really enjoyed our stay! It is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff is helpful and polite. They had great suggestions on where to eat, what to do, etc. We were within walking distance of many great Chicago locations like the Navy Pier and Art Institute. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable, I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great home away from home in Chicago."
"We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience! My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago. We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained, luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill. First of all, the hotel is all suites. We stayed in one of the "Premium Suites". The accommodations were definitely luxurious, with premium bedding, very nice robes for our use, and a choice of pillows. We used the hypo-allergenic ones, but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma, we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. There were actually two TVs in our suite. There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access, a wet bar, an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile, with so much to do practically at the Omni's doorstep. I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage, which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni. It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended. I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly, recommending several excellent area restaurants. However, we think our best meal was at the Omni's 676 Restaurant, where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass. They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance. Lastly, the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago, which was a highlight of our trip. We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future, where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again. We are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience!"
"The location of this hotel was superb! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular. The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect. One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter. We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same."
"The Omni Chicago Hotel was a delight to stay in. The second you step into the place, it takes your breath away. It's very modern with an antique twist. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. They are clean. Every member of the staff was courteous and polite. Proud of their place of work. Happy to be there. You don't often see that. The room service was phenomenal. Visiting Chicago was amazing, and staying at the Omni Hotel made my visit that much better. The luxurious pools were an added plus as well. I also enjoyed the gym facilities. I will definitely be staying at the Omni Hotel on my next visit. "
"Luxury and comfort combine to give a wonderful sense of relaxation for guests at the Omni Chicago Hotel. Their rooms are some of the cleanest and most well-furnished I have ever seen at a four-diamond hotel, and the 676 Lounge, which has accommodating late hours, was perfect for me to relax after a day of work. The workout room is absolutely HUGE, and each treadmill has its own TV to watch while working out - fantastic! Overall, my experience at the Omni was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Chicago!"
"The Omni Chicago Hotel I am a business woman who travels a great deal out of a month, therefore, my accommodations must meet the highest standards. I was booked for a stay at The Omni Chicago Hotel, located in what is referred to as ' The Magnificent Mile ' in the greater Chicago area. ' Magnificent ', it was! The beautifully red-bricked sky scraper was indeed a breath- taking sight and upon entrance, I had a felling of warmth from the very hospitable welcoming staff. I was impressed with the hotels special rates offered during prime business hours and the guest rooms ranged everything from ' The Presidential Suite to The Governors Suite '. I accepted a more humble room as I would not need to spend very much time there during the day. I did stay inside most nights and the amenities were more than satisfactory. I enjoyed the very spacious exercise room and afterwards, I would take a quick dip in the pool. I toured the hotel as my niece is planning her wedding and just so happens to live close to the hotel. The ' Chagall Ballroom ', was elegant enough for such an occasion and reeked of pure luxury. I was given very adequate maps and directions to and from as my business was conducted throughout the city. That was a life saver. All in all, my experience was more than favorable and I would definitely stay there again along with recommending it to anyone. "
"An excellent vacation destination. Clean rooms and many nice features. Superb location and proximity to local attractions. Staff is always friendly and eager to help. Highly recommended to anyone looking to travel to this area. "
"A hotel made for royalty. Decked out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of, it is an amazing experience! It's located right in the middle of everything in Chicago, and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience. The customer service was fantastic, as they were very responsive and polite to my requests and fixed any complaints without a complaint of their own. A beautiful experience that I would certainly do again!"
"I stayed here with my family when we were in Chicago on a family vacation. All I can say is WOW! A fantastic experience all around. First off, the hotel is magnificent, the lobby/entreway is jaw dropping to say the least. Everyone we dealt with from the desk clerks, to the cleaning staff, to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly. The rooms themselves are fantastic, perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation. The new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for! One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years! The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours. As usual, it had wifi, which was ultra cheap and very very fast. Over all i highly recommend The Palmer House Hilton!"
"The Palmer House Hlton Hotel has to be the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Chicago. I went to Chicago on a business trip for a meeting. When I arrived once I walked in, the lobby was beautiful, I couldn't hardly wait to see my room. The rooms were just as nice, the bathroom was immaculate! We had a meeting in the Clark Meeting Room, even that was nice! I wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself! I was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like, Grant Park, Lake Michigan, Mag Mile which is a shopping heaven, and the Navy Pier, it never really like the normal stressed out meetings. I love Chicago and I now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while I'm in town. "
"My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago for our anniversary. The hotel was beautiful and luxurious as one would expect from a Hilton brand hotel in a major city. The service was excellent with check-in and check-out going smoothly. The location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to attend the theater, visit the Lincoln Park zoo and picnic by the lake. All of these were very close to our hotel. The price was reasonable for the location and luxurious accommodations. We also enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge. Highly recommend. "
"If anyone is traveling to Chicago, I would strongly recommend the Palmer House Hilton. I have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and I was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel. I had a guest room with a double bed. At the first sight, the room had perfect decor. The double bed looked comfy and cozy. It wasn't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me. Since I was in a hurry in my two-day stay, I didn't have time to wander around the town for food. It wasn't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks. The good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night. I can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks. If you are just touring the city, the hotel is quite close to parks, museum, and a lot of shopping places. If you just need a place to stay, the view from the hotel was pretty good as well. Among all the hotels I have spent time in, the Palmer House Hilton tops the list. "
"My husband and I stayed at The Palmer House Hilton last month to celebrate our anniversary. What a wonderful hotel!! We had such a great weekend, largely thanks to The Palmer House. Every amenity we could want was right there at the hotel, at our fingertips. And the location is perfect--right in downtown Chicago. We stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites. It was exquisite--so elegant and beautiful. It was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in. The service was impeccable. Every employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed. We had our anniversary dinner at the Lockwood Restaurant in the hotel. It was delicious! We will definitely return to the Palmer House Hilton for our next special weekend getaway. "
"My husband and I snagged a great deal on a weekend trip to Chicago, and decided (at the recommendation of friends) to stay at the Palmer House Hilton. The only word we can use to describe it is "amazing"! Walking into the lobby feels like stepping back in time, it is simply breath-taking. Be sure to check out the ceiling, I have never seen one so beautiful outside of Europe. We checked-in without any issues and were assigned a very lovely room with the most comfortable bed I have encountered in any hotel. Everything is in walking distance of the Palmer House, you couldn't hope to find a better location for exploring downtown Chicago. Everything was perfect with our stay here, I would not stay anywhere else in Chicago from now on."
"The Palmer House Hilton is located in the heart of the theatre, financial and shopping districts of downtown Chicago. It is walking distance to museums, shopping, government and corporate buildings. The location makes it perfect for visiting Chicago. The rooms are luxurious, with super comfortable beds and soft sheets. The rooms was clean and quite nice looking. The hotel's restaurants are amazing. The hotel would definately exceed your expectations, whether you are a business traveler or there on vacation. "
"The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home. From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby, you will never want to leave. The multiple ballrooms, board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. If you're looking for leisure activities, there are two bars, the Lockwood Wine Cellar, and an indoor pool. The staff is professional, friendly and helpful. Room service is excellent, and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city. "
"The Palmer House Hilton hotel has it all for the business and leisure traveler out there! I stayed at this hotel on business and all I can say is WOW!!! One of the main things that I liked about the hotel was the indoor pool! I loved being able to go swimming even though it was December and 5 degrees outside! Also, the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings. I dined at Lockwood Restaurant and Bar and the food was amazing for a hotel! One thing that was a minor negative is that pets are allowed and my original room was next door to a barking dog, but the hotel staff was fantastic as switched up my room so I didn't have to deal with that! All in all, this hotel was fantastic and I look forward to the next time I get to stay here!"
"My husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couple's getaway from our usual life, and an escape it truly provided. There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time, let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us, because things like alarm clocks, hairdryers and ironing boards were already there, electronic media even available for rent. With a comfortable bed, control over how the room felt, no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call, we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity. Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning, but the Hilton was a true vacation. Thank you."
"Very beautiful hotel. The historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing. This hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which I enjoyed the spacious, tidy rooms. The staff here are very friendly, helpful, and professional. The concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel. I especially enjoyed the service at The Lockwood Restaurant here. Our server was excellent and the food was delicious! I must say this hotel exceeded my expectations. All in all, my stay was awesome!"
"Everything experienced at this hotel was grand. The hotel itself is stunning and the architecture is amazing. From the moment you walk into The Palmer House, you are greeted by friendly helpful staff. The rooms are out of this world with no detail overlooked. Comfortable beds, amazing bathrooms and breathtaking views of Chicago. If you are looking for an extravagant hotel for your next visit to the windy city, i would definately recommend you stay here. Experience Chicago like never before."
"The Palmer House Hilton is an incredible break from the real world. The lobby is a throwback to the grand era of travel, and you can just imagine people stepping off the train with their steamer trunks. The lobby is luxe and gilded, with soaring ceilings and is staffed with friendly, accommodating employees. The rooms are plush, with each bed furnished with a Serenity Dreams topper for extra comfort. The room decor is modern and sleek, a world from the tacky furnishings in most hotels. For your convenience, there's a fully-stocked business center, pool, fitness room and workout area - something to accommodate the solo, business or family traveller. "
"The Palmer House Hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence. The rooms are beautifully decorated, with class and superior quality furniture. The hotels restaurant "lockwood" consist's of delicious French and Italian cuisine. The location is in the prime area to downtown, and shopping areas. This hotel is suited for pristine guests, and those who are not willing to settle for less. If you're looking for not just any stay, but a stay in luxury, you should give The Palmer House Hilton a try. It is one of the best of the best in Chicago, and your stay will be one to remember."
"We really enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House Hilton. We were in Chicago for a weekend stay, and wanted something close to State Street, and convenient to the theatre district and the museums, and Michigan Ave. shopping. This is a grand old hotel, with just about every amenity one could wish for. The lobby is fabulous, and the hotel also has some nice restaurants . Our room had a nice king sized bed, and was pretty cozy. Hotel employees were very nice and helpful to us. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a "grand hotel" type experience at a reasonable price for the many amenities and in a very convenient spot in downtown Chicago. You will definitely feel special."
"The Palmer House Hilton was recommended to me by a friend who had visited Chicago the previous summer. I was very happy with the location , and was able to visit the nearby Lake Michigan and Millennium park (beautiful!!). The rooms were good size , and the right amount of luxury for the price. I didn't use room service much , but when I did everything was in order. "
"My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was wonderful. I was attracted to this Hotel because it was going to be me and my finance's first time in Chicago. The location of the hotel was perfectly placed Downtown Chicago We took advantage of the Hilton Bed and Breakfast Special. Upon Check in on Friday afternoon we went to the Lockwood restaurant before going to the room for the weekend. We stayed in a One Bedroom Suite with a King Size Bed. The Hotel was spotless. I have never been in a Hotel Room that was so clean. The portions of food was perfect, and everything they provided was on point. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to visit Chicago for the first time. The staff is professional, and let you feel like a King and Queen."
"Amazing! I was swept away when I walked into the hotel it was gorgeous. The staff was very nice and helpful the hotel was very clean, and the food was delicious. We stayed two nights and the first night we went to the Lockwood restaurant and we were blown away by the food. It has to be the best food in Chicago the atmosphere was very classy and warm and the wait staff was very precise. The decor in our rooms did not look like any hotel I had been at they were very elegant and inviting. I cannot wait to go back it is a true escape from daily life."
"My family and I stayed here while we were visiting Chicago. This was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around. It was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations. The staff was friendly and went the "extra mile" to make sure we had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. "
"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was an awesome place to stay. Nothing bad about it. It was a great value. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were nice and open, and the pool was great. Food was GREAT! My family and I loved staying here! Would recommend to everyone I know."
"If there is ever a Hotel you should stay at it is the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. This is the most beautiful Hotel I have ever seen. This Hotel has more than you will ever need or want. You can pick from a room that is decorated in great taste. There is a in room refreshment center,high speed Internet, 32 inch television ,coffer maker with great coffee from Starbucks. You could get a suite or the Presidential suite with more room than you will ever need. The room is over 2000 square feet.It over looks the Chicago River. There is plenty of activities with a great fitness center and a big indoor heated pool.The sauna was just wonderful. If you want to sight see in the area you can walk to the Navy pier,or Art Institute. When you come back hungry you can eat at the elegant steakhouse which had some of the best food we ever ate. Have a few drinks at the great bar, then create your own burger at the Chicago Burger Company. The staff was very friendly and super helpful. The Hotel was the cleanest I have ever seen. I will come again and again. A big thumbs up to this great Hotel. "
"What a gorgeous hotel! From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago. The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better, and to top it off with great restaurants, you couldn't ask a hotel for more! Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we'll be back every time we visit Chicago. "
"When my sister got married last summer, our stay at the Sheraton Hotel was delightful! Billy and the kids and I were exhausted after the long flight from San Francisco, so it's a good thing that we found the perfect place to relax! The kids ADORED the indoor pool, Billy couldn't stop talking about the beautiful jogging path, and I even pampered myself by taking advantage of the massage therapy before the big day. The reception dinner at Shula's Steakhouse was fun and delicious. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any one who is in Chicago for an extended visit!"
"My Stay at Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was wonderful, i stayed in the traditional guest room and i slept good, i was able to get to my meeting well rested, thank you Sheraton! -Bobby"
"Thanks Sheraton Towers for the invite to enjoy your indoor pool while a guest at your hotel recently. I did not know that the skyline of Chicago could be so beautiful or an afternoon at the pool so enjoyable. I'll be back soon and look forward to a seeing Chicago again."
"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is my favorite place to stay in Chicago! I travel to Chicago very often to visit my son, who is training for the U.S. Navy. They make every stay feel like a luxorius vacation. The indoor pool and sauna are amazing, and I never have to miss a workout because the gym is fully equipped. If you dine at the LB Bistro, you must try the Eggs Benedict :) The staff are friendly and the prices are very reasonable for a hotel of this stature."
"I walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that I would have a wonderful stay in Chicago. After walking around the city all day, I was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place. The service was friendly and I especially liked the location. What a Treat!"
"This is an absolutely gorgeous hotel. We had an amazing view of the city, especially at night. Our room was luxurious with extremely comfortable beds. There was a desk and chair, large bathroom, comfortable chair and reading lamp. There was also an area for snacks and a coffee maker, that included Starbucks coffee. We would definitely come back again! "
"We were hungry and tired when we checked into the Chicago Sheraton. The nice clerk at the front desk got us checked in efficiently and with a warm smile. He made us dinner reservations at Shula's (giving us time to shower and change) and arranged for a bellhop to take our bags up to the room for us - what service!! We enjoyed our steaks and the bottle of wine that was recommended by the waiter at Shula's - truly a lovely meal. When we returned to our room we were delighted to find that the towels had been replenished and the bed turned down! We enjoyed the view from our room before turning in and having a very restful night's sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed. KUDOS to the Chicago Sheraton for getting everything just right! "
" My wife and I's stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers proved to be the perfect complement to our time spent visiting and exploring the Windy City. Upon our arrival, we were immediately welcomed by the beautiful design of the first-floor lobby and the friendly demeanor of the desk and bell service staff. In seemingly no time at all we were in our clean and well-furnished room with a beautiful and peaceful view of Lake Michigan. In terms of accommodations, I have never personally stayed at a hotel that I could complement more. On our very first night, my wife took advantage of a message therapy session while I swam a few laps in the heated indoor swimming pool. We followed our time apart with a very relaxing time at the Chi bar, which had a very enlivening and laid-back atmosphere. Retiring to our rooms, I couldn't help but remark to my wife about the quality of our room and the bed in particular. I had a very comfortable night's sleep and woke up just on time thanks to a spot-on wake up call from the desk staff. After a quick bite to eat the LB Bistro, we headed out to sight-see. Overall, I can't recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers enough. As far as this customer is concerned, it is the only place to stay if you are in the Chicago area and are looking for accommodations with the best customer service, atmosphere, and amenities. I couldn't recommend it more. "
" I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers a couple nights ago. The service was excellent!! As soon as i stepped through the door they grabbed my bags, and were helping me choose the best hotel room for me! I loved there service and the room was gorgeous! I highly recommend it for anyone, and there prices aren't as bad as others. I loved the experience and I'm sure next time I'm in the area I'll visit again!"
"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel for two nights and I must say the service they rendered was quite impressive. They had very attentive and friendly staff members. The room that I stayed in was spacious for me and my husband. Their hotel restaurant served the most delicious steaks I have tasted, I ordered a classic fillet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if ever I come back to Chicago and would absolutely highly recommend this to my friends and family."
"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was everything you could ask for in a hotel. It was meticulously clean, very orderly, but still perfectly warm and comforting. The rooms are very big and spacious, and the beds are so soft, it's like heaven! I didn't test out the room service, but I'm sure it would be just like everything else... perfect!The hotel staff are just so nice. There was a spectacular view from my room, and looking out over the city at night is so magical. There are resturants that are easy to access from the hotel, and I especially recommend Shula's Steak House. Overall, I had a fantastic stay at The Sheraton Hotel, and I would definitely stay there again!"
"The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a magnificent grand hotel. The size of the rooms, and the views of the city are phenomenal. At night the city lights up, and the sight is majestic. The hotel itself, and the employee's are wonderful, and well worth the pay to stay in such a place. This Hotel has so much to offer, great dining,a fantastic gym set up for those of us, who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing.My wife and I have just left recently, and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out. Big thumbs up to Those who run that place, and helped us enjoy our stay."
"My husband and I loved this hotel. The staff were friendly, the food on the room service menu was a reasonable price, and we got an extra (free) coffeepot in our room immediately when we asked for it. Highly recommended!"
"I was completely unfamiliar with Chicago but needed a place to stay while my husband worked there for a few days and we picked the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based solely on their internet site. Wow did I get lucky! This is a beautiful hotel with all of amenities I could have hoped for, terrific food, and within walking distance of several interesting places, including the Art Institute of Chicago. Ashley, at the concierge desk, was particularly helpful at guiding a Chicago newbie to the best places to eat ands to see. I will heartily recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers."
"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for three days while I was in Chicago on business. This was quite possibly the best hotel experience that I have ever had, which says a lot considering the fact that I stay in hotels quite frequently. The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. They made sure that I had absolutely everything that I could want or need. Their friendliness came across in a very genuine manner, not fake or forced like some employees can be. The room itself was to die for. The bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept. I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding! Because of the mattress and bedding, I got the best three nights of sleep I've ever had. The views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room. The way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago. The food was amazing also. I made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel's restaurants and visit the bar while I was there. My favorite restaurant of the three was Shula's Steak House. The Chi Bar, the hotel's bar, was amazingly designed and the drinks were great. All in all, i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5. There is nowhere else in downtown Chicago that compares to the Sheraton."
"I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on a recent trip to Chicago, and had a great stay. The rooms were beautiful, the beds comfortable, and the views of the city were fantastic. My room overlooked the river and the city. I felt like I was on a luxury vacation. The hotel has a few different restaurants. I ate at the Chicago Burger Company, which was delicious. The burgers were juicy, and the prices were great. The indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities. Overall, I had a wonderful stay. "
"On our first trip to Chicago, my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel. In the past from other "luxury hotels" we have paid much more and received much less. Here the room were very spacious, comfortable and sleek. We spent come time in the hotel bar, LE BAR, and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time. If traveling with a lover we recommend the "Air of Romance" package. It was the best! 6 stars!"
"This is an absolutely exquisite hotel, at a great location, and boasting superb amenities. I was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on Michigan Ave. The hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk. I appreciated the homey, well-designed interior and views of the city. It was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so I didn't have to wander the city for my late night meal. This will definitely be my hotel of choice when I return to the city. "
"This hotel was gorgeous! I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future. The staff was friendly, the room was clean, comfortable and very well decorated. The restaurant/ room service was also exceptional. The food was delicious and the room service was prompt. This hotel is also in a great location. It is close to everything anyone may need, such as shopping, food and attractions."
"I traveled to Chicago with my husband for a romantic weekend away. Our stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower could not have been more luxurious! Our room had anything you could ever want, a mini bar, air conditioning. We were also within walking distance of many sites and fun restaurants. The staff was friendly, and the beds were like clouds. Overall,the experience was worth every penny. "
"I stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend, and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. The spacious rooms with modern, innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small, dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains. The bathrooms were neat, tidy, and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper, shampoo, and soap. The carpet was clean (not stained and dingy like some hotels), the room decor was astounding, and the view from our window was wonderful. I enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay, from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. Thanks for making me feel right at home!"
"I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. After my business stuff was over I really got out and enjoyed Chicago. I met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. When I go back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Sofitel again."
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for our wedding anniversary - and what a pleasant stay we had! From the first moment we walked in, we were overwhelmed at the classy elegance of the lobby. I casually mentioned that it was our anniversary, and after we came back from dinner, we found champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room. The staff was professional but friendly, and made us feel so welcome. The room was immaculate, the furnishings were so plush - we didn't really want to go home! Room service was prompt, and the views were spectacular! We are definitely going to make this visit a yearly repeat. "
"I think the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a upscale place.I had my wedding there and it was the best of the best.The staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success. The chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts.They also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake.The tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect.The bar was also set up the way I wanted it and even had a champagne fountain. My guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered.The rooms were like suites with a mini bar.They had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom. If you are looking to have a wedding in the Chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed!"
"MY WIFE AND I STAYED HERE LAST WEEKEND. IT WAS OUR HONEYMOON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL. THIS HOTEL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT. WE WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH OUR ROOM AND THE RESTURANT WAS AMAZING. ALL OF THE STAFF HERE WERE VERY NICE AND POLITE. THEY HELPED US WITH ANY OF OUR NEEDS. I WISH I COULD LIVE IN THIS PLACE. ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WEEKENDS OF OUR LIVES. WE PLAN ON COMING BACK AGAIN. GREAT HOTEL!"
"Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a four star hotel that is minutes aways from the Magnificent mile, Navy Peir, The museum of contemperary art, lake michigan and upscale boutiques. This hotel is great for tourest. it has 450 great rooms and 33 high end sweets. It has a modern diesighn and rich arcitechusall legacy. IT has great food and out door dinning it also has a great veiws, while drinking wine and champane cotails in there amazing bar. Overall this hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in."
"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids. Upon check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor, the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff. As a seasoned traveler for business I consider myself somewhat savvy when it comes to service and accommodations. This hotel certainly delivers on both accounts. My wife and I had not intended on eating in the hotel restaurant, but after reviewing the menu we thought we would give it a try. WOW! Service was outstanding and the food was amazing. We truly enjoyed our dining experience. All in all I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone I meet. "
"This hotel is beautiful, it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it. The location is wonderful,it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier, which was a great place to show the children on our vacation. We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car,and the valet was very nice and helpful. I also take my work with me everywhere I go,So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus. They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing. This place is great for the price, due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is. This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay. "
"The Sofitel Water Tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to Chicago. We got married in the city but then moved away, and it was so romantic to return. We loved how near the Sofitel was to everything - the Magnificent Mile was just outside our door, and we could walk to Navy Pier and other attractions as well. Chicago has changed, but the Sofitel made it feel like home again... except a very plush and elegant version of home! We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had great views of the city, and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. Both nights before leaving for supper, we had a cocktail in Le Bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day, and all the great memories this town has for us. But I have to say we have some new great memories now, thanks to the Sofitel Water Tower!"
"I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and I could not be more pleased. The hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern, stylish rooms. The rooms are something truly special with huge, soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt. The bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower/tub. If that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32" LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system. When you finally make it out of your room, down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant. It is called Cafe des Architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic French techniques. Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile. A full dinner including appetizer, main course, and dessert can be had for $45, amazing. If you are looking for a modern, urban, chic hotel in Chicago then look no further, the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel is your only real choice."
" If you are traveling anywhere near Lake Michigan within the next year or less, I would highly recommend staying at The Sofitel Hotel. Unbeatable elegance, fine dining, and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. Along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. If there were such a thing as a 10 star rating, The Sofitel would surely have it. My visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. Located minutes from everything in downtown Chicago, one would hardly want to leave. Fine dining, dancing, and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting, or social event in town. The Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave."
"I would like to add a comment, maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination. My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower; we were amazed. She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding, and Sofitel made this happen for her. They took care of all the invitations, cake decor, and so much more. The special day for my daughter was worth everything. If you are going to be in the Chicago area, check them out; you will not regret it!"
"Best hotel in an excellent location I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a Business purpose. My 1 year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room. The front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly . The room service was also good. The room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good . I like the decor of the room. The French restaurant in Sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining . I will surely prefer to stay in Sofitel on a next time travel to Chicago."
"Couldn't have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown Chicago. Hotel Sofitel is right in the heart of the action, allowing my friends and I to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown's famous for. The room was comfy, with two queen mattresses, down stuffed duvets and chic decor. The bar downstairs was a bit pricey, but made up for it by being comfortable, sleek, and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails. One night we didn't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the Cafe des Architectes, which had an amazing array of choices, mostly of the French persuasion. I would definitely book here again! "
"I was very satisfied after staying at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. The service was excellent, as the staff was very helpful and polite. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms were very spacious. I will definitely be returning to this hotel."
"My stay at the Sofitel was great. I loved the location it was in. From the moment I arrived the experince was great, the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too. I thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable. The room service was excllent and they were very friendly. Checkout was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay. "
"I absolutely loved staying at the Swissotel Chicago. The entire hotel has such an elegant and luxurious feel to it. The room was absolutely stunning! First of all, it was so spotless and clean. The design of it was beautiful! There was gorgeous artwork on the walls even. The design was very modern and above average for hotel decor. There was a separate bath and separate shower which I loved! There was a huge LCD flat screen TV and high speed wireless Internet available. There was even an iPod docking station which was great for listening to music and so convenient since I brought my iPod with me! The view from the window of Chicago was beautiful too. The service was very quick and everyone was very friendly. I didn't have any problems at all but if I did I'm sure the customer service at the hotel would have had it fixed very quick I could tell their top priority was the guests happiness and satisfaction! There were even two restaurants in the hotel and a lounge! I can't wait to go back to this hotel. It felt like I was on a luxurious vacation! "
"The Swissotel Chicago was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at in Chicago. It was clean, modern, and the staff were very friendly, even to our large family with cranky kids at a very late hour. The room was fantastic and you can not beat it for the price. Not only was the room fantastic, but so was the view. Our room looked out over the skyline and it was breathtaking, especially at night. The best part of the hotel was its location. It was located within walking distance to so many fun attractions, including Navy Pier and the Sears Tower. Our stay was wonderful, and we can't wait to go back again. "
"A perfect place for couples to get away too. The location couldn't be better,just three blocks from Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile. It's really romantic, the service was awesome. Very clean and quiet. It has big rooms with comfortable atmosphere, huge bathroom.Over all, i had the a great experience there, would definitely stay there again!"
"Stays here while on a business trip in Chicago. First off the staff were very friendly and helpful. They were knowledgeable about the things in the area when I needed to find something. I had a king bed room - it was very clean and cozy and the view was great. This is definitely a hotel I will stay at again if my work takes me back to Chicago."
"Everything you would would expect from a top-notch hotel and exceeded by the service. The trendy decor and easy to access dining gave us a 'second-wind' pick up after a day of sight-seeing. This hotel is definitely the place that I want to come back to. By the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights, my wife and I wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful Swiss flare. One of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window. The feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind. "
"Staying at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago is not so much the typical stay so much as it is an experience. Not only is the hotel located in a great area to get to all local attractions, but while you are at the hotel you will have many amazing accommodations at your disposal. There are two gourmet on site restaurants and a lounge to relax and get great food. The rooms are over sized and the beds are among the most comfortable you will ever find. Finally, the service is award winning so anything that you do not already have at the Swissotel will be at your fingertips with their assistance. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for more than the typical hotel."
"My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel. It was much nicer than we expected. We are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this, by far, was one of the nicest places we've stayed. The beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib! The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home! We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago."
"I must say, this hotel is absolutely beautiful. My wife and I were blown away by the penthouse fitness center and pool all the way up on the 42nd floor. Very well designed rooms with great linens and pillows. The bathrooms were a nice change of pace from the boring hotel bathrooms we usually see. Overall an excellent experience here, great views and close to everything you could want to do in Chicago."
"This hotel was wonderful. My room was clean and the staff was courteous. The food provided by the restaurant was exceptional. This was on of the best hotel stays, ive experienced. I highly suggest this hotel to others. "
" We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago. It was elegant, classy, and the service was impeccable. It was very family friendly for us, with the spacious rooms, the kid's room, and the no smoking policy. We were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see. The food was delicious and we didn't have to go outside the hotel to find good food. When visiting Chicago again, we will come back. It was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price. Linda Davies "
"This hotel is one superior hotel. The prices are reasonable and the benefits are just fantastic. My husband and I got a package that lets us get a hotel with a view and the view was amazing. Waking up to seeing Lake Michigan was a site not to miss. The rooms were always cleaned when we got back from our shopping at Bloomingdales or in other places in Chicago, and the customer service was top notch and very friendly."
"If you are ever going to visit Chicago and need a place to stay I recommend this hotel. This hotel made my stay in Chicago one that I will always remember. The rooms were very big and luxurious, everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service. The room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so I could get anything whenever I wanted. The price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because I got great service and I saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite. If you are ever going to be in the Chicago area and need a hotel to stay in I recommend this hotel!"
"I stayed at this hotel for a weekend and I thought it was really nice. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. The room also had a beautiful view. It had everything you could possibly need. I almost didn't want to leave the room. It was definitly worth the price. I would go back. The clientel was also very helpful. "
"My husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago, when my husband went for a trade fair. We got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money. Clean and comfortable, chic and new fixtures. The view of the pier was magnificent. Staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow. It's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty."
"The Swissotel Chicago is a delight to visit. Located in downtown Chicago this hotel has nine different styles of room accommodations to serve everyones taste. They have children friendly rooms as well as the exquisite presidential suite. Rooms have exceptional views of downtown Chicago. This hotel also has a penthouse fitness center and pool for entertainment. Other places to stop by to eat is the Palms, Geneva and the Lobby Lounge."
"Beautiful views and awesome service! My husband and I stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago while meeting up with some old friends from college. We have been to Chicago a few times but never stayed at this hotel before. First off the architecture and feel of the hotel is just amazing. So beautiful! The views from our corner suite was breathtaking and the accomodations were flawless. The fact that we could have an apartment like setting rather than a cold hotel room made all the difference. From the big tub in the bath to the entertainment system and work area, everything is in place to make your stay like being at home but with an awesome view of the Chicago Skyline. We took advantage of the Executive Club for desserts and breakfast and had dinner one night at the Palm restaurant. Delicious food! We will definitely stay at the Swissotel the next time we visit Chicago."
"Elegant and modernized hotel with great staff. Location is wonderful. The health club located in the hotel had everything needed to get my complete workout. I will be staying there again due to the wonderful experience and decent prices."
"When I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago, I immediately went to their website to check them out. What I found there was decent, nothing really stood out. It wasn't until I actually went there that my eyes were opened. The amazing customer service I received there was exceptional. Every whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly. The room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day. When I asked about more towels, the maids were happy to help me out. If I were ever to be in that area again, I know exactly where I'm staying, the Swissotel."
"This is the hotel for the discriminating business traveler. It offers spacious rooms that are elegant and refined. With a cozy area complete with chairs and fireplace, they are the perfect place to entertain clients or discuss strategy for a business meeting with a colleague. The restaurant offers just the location to impress a perspective client. And all of this elegance and refinement in the heart of downtown Chicago"
"I stayed at Swissotel Chicago when I was on business and it was very nice. The staff was very helpful and room was very clean. I would stay again in a heart beat!"
"I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three. I absolutely loved it and will definitely return! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic. They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay. For the nights we didn't want to go out, we had room service. The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick. I also loved their commitment to the environment. It is clear to me why they have won so many awards. Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay!"
""Classy","Decent" and "Serene". these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago. the hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel. the lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle.the staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite, helpful and responsive to my needs. the room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home, making the talbott a home away from home. my wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer. believe me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids. it felt very safe. anytime we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home!"
"The Talbott Hotel is fantastic! I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. The high speed internet access worked flawlessly; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. I really like to exercise before a day of meetings; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. Last point: I work for a green consulting firm out of L.A. and the hotel's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission. Guilt free luxury!"
"This hotel was everything we were looking for. My mom and I were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out. The Talbott Hotel was incredible. The rooms were very clean and spacious and had everything we needed. The hotel check in was easy and the guest services folks were awesome! They even gave us tips on great restaurants in the area. Highly recommend this hotel on your next trip to chicago!"
"My husband and I decided to plan a romantic get-away for our one year anniversary when we stumbled upon the Talbott Hotel in Chicago. We decided to book the "Personally Yours Romance Package" for our stay. When we arrived at the hotel, the staff was very friendly and approachable. The personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch. Each night, we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed. The personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and I to see a Chicago Cubs baseball game. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away."
"This is the best hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago. I travel a lot, both for business and vacation. The Talbott Hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome, and elegant. Not to mention all the modern features that I'm used to having at home, are available in the room. I brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite. She didn't even want to leave the room. The concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner. "
"My stay at the Talbott was a wonderful experience. The service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations, the Gold Coast location is close to Michigan Ave, the museums, and many of the other sites Chicago has to offer.If you are visiting Chicago, I highly recommend the Talbott!"
"Great Hotel! The staff is friendly, corteous, and professional. They made me feel like I was a returning guest which I was not (but I will be!). The rooms were very clean and I slept well in the comfy bed. They have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that I took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside. My only issue was the battery for the TV remote died. However, a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about 2 minutes! 5 stars!!!"
"I really loved my stay at the Talbott. My room was amazing! The bathroom (and I am VERY picky about hotel bathrooms) had ample room for all of my stuff, which is a bonus for me. The staff treated me really well and they were very friendly. I was afraid that I'd get a little lost, since it was my first trip to Chicago, but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area (Rush St./Michigan Ave.-- which are *very* close by). The hotel reminded me of those I'd stayed at in Europe. The room service is 24 hours, which for me, was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights. This is the *only* place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again. For a single woman traveling alone to a strange city, this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable."
"This hotel was an absolute dream to stay in. I couldn't have picked a better hotel to spend in such luxury. I enjoyed the set up of the rooms and the space they offered.The room decor was extremely elegant and the location was great as well. I honestly felt like I was at a spa! The price was very reasonable as well. I would definetly recommend this hotel to everyone I know. If you ever get a chance to spend a night here definetly choose the suite rooms!!!"
"Very luxurious and worth the money. If you are looking to relax and unwind in a great hotel then this is the one to choose. The staff was great and friendly. Dont forget the 24 hour room service which is a great treat."
"I was visiting relatives in Chicago and wanted to stay in a hotel that emphasized luxury and was also environmentally friendly, and the Talbott seemed to fit the bill. I also couldn't help but notice all the positive reviews online. I figured I couldn't go wrong and I am happy to report the positive reviews are true. First of all check in was a breeze. I love their online reservation system. It was easy to use and the information presented was quick and accurate. Once I arrived in Chicago I was greeted by Tim at the door and I immediately felt like wanted and liked. The receptionist was very polite and when she heard I was visiting Chicago for the first time, she upgraded my Deluxe King to an Executive King. Score! The room was just as advertised, luxurious and convenient. It was also exceptionally clean and this is very important to me because I am paranoid of germs and bed bugs. Most importantly though, I got a good night's sleeep because the bed and pillows were super soft, but firm enough to help support my back. I also used the Equinox Fitness Club and, wow, what a club. This is another great amenity of the Talbott and easily beats other hotels skimpy workout centers. My check-out was quick, easy, and painless. This hotel gets my highest recommendation. The facilities are immaculate and modern with the recent upgrade, the staff is ultra-friendly and competent, and the location was perfect for my needs. "
"The Talbot hotel is an elegant place to take you wife or husband for a weekend getaway. The personally yours romantic package was fabulous. Upon check in we opened our room door and found a romantic atmosphere. There was rose pedals and luxurious bathrobes. We felt like it was our honey moon all over again. "
"The atmosphere at the Talbott Hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in. The employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive. The hotel seems to be luxurious, even from the lobby, and right away, I was very excited for my stay! I stayed in a double queen room with my friend. The room is spacious enough, and beds are very comfortable. I didn't try the room service, but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa, which is very convenient. I also love how the room has individual climate controls! Very neat! Also handy that there is an iHome in the room. I'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels. I will most likely stay in this hotel another time. It was a wonderful experience!"
"At first my husband and I were really excited for our family to enjoy the T-Rex Experience package. We figured it would be a great deal package even though the hotel itself felt too "ritzy" for us to travel with our four children. But after two nights of downtown Chicago fun we realized that The Talbott transcends it's ritzy look and truly embraces a family friendliness which we thoroughly enjoyed."
"The rates at The Talbott Hotel were cheaper than I had expected, and that was my reason for booking a room. I had been prepared for service and a room similar to what I had experienced in the past, and I was quite pleased when I did stay. The room was neat and clean, and the halls were quiet at night. The traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either. I did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely, which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy, especially at night. Overall I had no problems with The Talbott Hotel and I would stay at this here again if I were in the area a second time."
"I enjoyed my stay at the Talbott Hotel. It is on the more expensive side, but it is all worth it. I got the Talbott tradition package, which was $245 for two people and included a $30 breakfast credit on check out day. The rooms are huge! The beds are soft and comfortable. They include Aveda bath products, which is a plus in my book. They also have a nice fitness area & pool you can use while you stay there. One thing I thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone. My boyfriend also liked the Ihome audio system. The location of this hotel is very convenient as well, its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast. But, what I like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to. They were one of the first hotels to be Green Sealed. Overall I had a great stay at Talbott Hotel!"
"Pleasant staff and housekeeping. Above average breakfast. The rooms were clean and the staff made sure we had fresh linnens. It was bedbug free!! I would definitely stay there again."
"My stay at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had! The location, service and accommodations were all outstanding!! The lobby area is beautiful as was my room. In the room there was more than enough space, which is difficult to find in Chicago hotels. My only gripe was the room was a little dark. Sure, staying at a small, upper-class hotel like the Talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. The service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. The room service took a bit longer than I would have liked, however, the food was good quality. Another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the Equinox Fitness Center. Finally, the location is PERFECT!! It's located in a beautiful area of the city near the Gold Coast, which has many very good restaurants. A personal favorite of mine is Mario's, a nice Italian place nearby. Overall, my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were, for the most part, insignificant."
"excellent staff and customer service, very clean and spotless. elegant and luxurious with a beautiful ocean view. the bed is very comfortable and relaxing. i give it a five star."
"I had just recently moved to Chicago and saw this fabulous seafood restaurant around the corner from my apartment. Being from Vancouver and having access to fresh seafood all the time, I immediately requisitioned a few friends to try out Joe's Seafood last night. It was a hit! The host immediately seated us when we walked through the door, and the decor was great - simple and elegant. While we browsed the menu (did I say extensive?), we had ordered a bottle of white wine (from Napa Valley!) to accompany our meals. I couldn't choose, so I got the fisherman's platter following an appetizer of shrimp & scallop ceviche. My god! Even Maria, who's Peruvian, thought it was amazing. My friends got the stone crab and Chilean sea bass, and my boyfriend, Jeff, being the type of guy he is, went for the rib-eye. The prices were just right, and the food was excellent! We easily spent three hours here, finishing our meals and catching up. I was sorely tempted to get dessert, but by the end of our meals, I was so full that I made plans to come back on my own the next day. Oh, they do take-out AND have a gluten free menu - what's not to love? The service is great, and the menu has a lot of food that even the pickiest eater would have trouble finding fault with. My only complaint would be that there were no pictures on the menu (I'm a visual type of person), so it was hard to gauge the portions. All in all, this place comes highly recommended - you won't be disappointed. Make reservations in advance!"
"Frontera Grill has some of the most delicious food choices in a great atmosphere. It's a pretty casual restaurant with awesome staff who make you feel right at home. It's very colorful and they take great pride in keeping a clean restaurant. You can tell they only use the freshest ingredients in their authentic Mexican menu choices. I can't wait to try all of their menu options and would highly recommend this place to anyone. try it and you won't be disappointed!"
"My boyfriend took me to dinner last week at Frontera Grill. What a fun place! We started with Guacamole, and can I just say... it was amazing! I ordered Tacos Al Carbon, and they were so yummy. We had a great time, the service was outstanding and we will definitely be going back there again."
"Wow. This restaurant is wonderful! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is a delight. Frontera Grill changes their menu every so often which I love because it keeps me coming back for more. The food is always delicious so I am excited to try what's coming up next. The people working at Frontera are always polite and friendly. I couldn't ask for better service! The place is so nicely decorated that it makes you feel right at home. I think you should come on in. I believe you'll love it just as I do!"
"I'm a big fan of bbq. Every Sunday as a family we enjoy grilling, but those days when we don't feel like cooking we make our way to the Weber Grill Restaurant. They have everything imagined my favorite are the ribs. It's a friendly environment for the whole family. They even have an awesome happy hour. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't know what they want to eat. I love coming to Webers Grill so much that it's makes me never want to cook on Sundays."
"My wife and I were on vacation/visiting friends in Indy looking for a good local restaurant for dinner when we came upon the Weber Grill Restaurant. It looked good from the outside and we later found that the food served inside was even better. We wondered if the name was the same Weber of the grill fame and it turned our it is. I am always in the mood for a great steak or chops, so lucky for me the Weber Grill specializes in these items. I chose the Lamb chops because I cannot turn them down when I find them on a menu. My wife opted for the strip steak. Both were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The sides were great and the portion sizes were generous. Neither of us were super hungry after the main course, but the double chocolate bundt cake looked too good to turn down so we split one. Good decision on ordering and sharing it. It was awesome. But there is no way I could have finished the whole thing myself. If you are ever near any of the handful of Weber Grill locations, stop in and you will not regret it."
"This restaurant was absolutely wonderful! I came here with my wife a few days ago and the atmosphere was so calm and warming. Weber Grill was a wonderful place for our anniversary dinner, and we will definitely be going back again soon. The service was great, the menu diverse and very professional looking, and the overall visit exceeded our expectations. Definitely one of my new favorites! Oh, and our food was delicious and cooked perfectly to our expectation!"
"I recently visited the Weber Grill Restaurant with my husband for a special 50th anniversary dinner. I was very pleasantly surprised with the service that we received, it was exceptional! We found ourselves surrounded by a lovely atmosphere and smiles everywhere we turned. The food was delicious as well, ( I had the Prime New York Strip ) which I highly recommend. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and you could really taste the difference that the charcoal grilling made in the flavor of the meat. We will certainly be back again!"
"Weber Grill Restaurant has undoubtedly win me over! My wife and I needed a place to celebrate our anniversary, and after checking the menu online decided to try Weber Grill Restaurant. We were promptly welcomed and sited very quickly. Our waitress was very polite and efficient throughout our meal. In fact, the whole staff seems very well trained and eager to give us the best experience possible. Weber being popular for their grilling, I ordered the Prime NY Strip and my wife ordered the Grill Twin Lobster Tails. The food met my expectations and then some! The steak was cooked perfectly and had that amazing back-yard grill taste to it. The Lobster tails were delicious and you could taste the freshness; my picky wife found nothing to complain about! So needless to say I will be coming back! Weber Grill Restaurant, keep doing what you do so well, and thank you for an excellent experience!!"
"There is not a restaurant in Chicago that I would more recommend than Weber Grill Restaurant. We were able to be seated right away when we came in. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were able to suggest the perfect meal, seeing that it was my first time eating at the restaurant. My Prime NY Strip was cooked exactly the way I asked. My husband ordered lobster and he was satisfied as well. They were also very family friendly, and had some great options for my youngest child. Last but not least, the wine was some of the best that I have ever tasted. For such a great meal, this restaurant was surprisingly very affordable. I would definitely recommend it."
"When I go to a restaurant there are 3 things I, and generally every rational person, looks for: quality, cleanliness, and excellent customer service. And Weber Grill Restaurant really knocks it out of the park categories. On the occasion that I attended this establishment, accompanied by my wife, we were first greeted by a warm, friendly hostess. I believe her name was Stella, we were promptly seated. The restaurant was about 3/4 of the way full, and shortly after being seated we met our waiter Joseph, who was prompt and thorough the whole time and. While waiting for our food I could not help but notice how clean and well decorated the restaurant was. It definitely looked like it could be a 5 star restaurant. For lunch I ordered "The Smokey Joe" and my wife had the "Southwest Turkey Wrap". Being from the south I had low expectations for a restaurant serving Barbecue above the Bible Belt. But the food really exceeded my expectations, not necessarily the quality of a 9-hour slow smoked brisket back home, but it was definitely one of the best damn Barbecue sandwiches I have had. I will definitely be back to this gem in the future. 4.5/5.0 Stars."
"There are lots of places to get steaks in Chicago . . .but getting a great steak? That is a lot harder - unless you go to Joe's. We try and go every time we have out of town guests because there is no better way to showcase Chicago style steakhouses than Joe's. On the last visit, I had the seared Ahi tuna. It was a sushi grade cut of tuna, barely shown the grill before meeting my plate and arrived promptly. It was one of the best cuts of tuna I have ever had - almost as good as one on the beach overseas where I pointed to the tuna on a boat and it was cut and cooked on the beach. The tuna was that fresh. On prior visits, I've also had the salmon, chicken, and the ribeye. Service usually excellent, and the waiters are quite knowledgeable about wine pairings. Overall, I am always looking for an excuse to go back to Joe's!"
"My familyao>>s experience at Weber Grill Restaurant in Chicago was tremendous. The staff was warm, welcoming and able to answer all of our questions about the menu items. The lunch menu was more than reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food that was served. All of our entrees tasted wonderful, especially the Margherita pizza. The atmosphere provided was the best Iao>>ve ever experienced. We will definitely be visiting again, with friends next time!"
"Don't let the name fool you, the Weber Grill Restaurant is more than just hamburgers and hot dogs and as I found out this last weekend, one of the best steak houses around. My dining experience began this last Saturday around 6:00 pm and upon arriving at the Weber Grill I immediately assumed that I would be waiting for a while before being seated due to the fact that there almost wasn't an empty parking spot in the whole lot. To my pleasant surprise however I only had to wait about five minutes before being seated. I reviewed the menu and decided to splurge and ordered the Prime NY strip, medium well. The steak, which arrived in less than 15 minutes, was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The Parmesan Truffle Mashed Potatoes and grilled asparagus were a perfect pairing with the steak as well as the house made steak sauce. Equally as pleasurable as the meal was the service as well as the atmosphere. Overall my dining experience was extremely pleasurable and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this fine dining experience giving it a 5 out of 5 stars. Thank you Weber grill,"
"My wife and I went to the Weber Grill Restaurant a few weeks ago. The waitstaff was excellent, but expect a wait, even at the bar. I had the Grilled Colorado Lamb Chops and she had the Prime NY Strip. The food was absolutely amazing and I can easily say that these are the best lamb chops I've ever had."
"The Weber Grill is a fantastic Restaurant. Anytime you want mouth watering steak, this is the place to go. The NY Strip Steaks are delectable. Although it's a little pricey, it's definitely worth it. The atmosphere is sub par to none and all the waiters are super hospitable. I felt like they were my personal waiters. This is definitely the place to take a date on a romantic night out."
"I went to Weber Grill last night with my boyfriend and we had a great time! The live music made the whole atmosphere cool and the food was to die for! The Plank Grilled Chilean Sea Bass practically melted in my mouth and the vinaigrette dressing added a really nice touch. The asparagus was crisp but not crunchy and the recommended wine really kissed my palette! My boyfriend had the Prime NY Strip and said that was amazing too. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great, upscale night out! The food is affordable for the atmosphere and quality, and anyone can easily lose themselves in a great time."
"So we went to Weber Grill Restaurant for lunch. I was entertaining some clients and thought I would try this place since I heard they had great lunch specials. It was a gamble, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had made a reservation for 4 and upon arrival, we only had to wait a few seconds before being escorted to our table. The hosts were very friendly and let us know our waiter would be right with us. Usually, at a busy lunch restaurant, one can only hope to be helped immediately, but they seemed to have plenty of staff to go around and we were helped right away. Joe was our waiter and you can tell he really cares about his customers having a great lunchtime experience in a timely fashion. I ordered the grilled vegetable panini off their $10 lunch special. It arrived nice and hot and the portion was quite sizable. My clients were also happy with their orders and we were greeted by the waiter at various times during our meal to make sure our drinks were refilled. We made it out in a reasonable amount of time given the volume of people in the restaurant, so I would definitely come back for a lunch meeting if Weber's keeps up this level of service. A+!!"
"Great atmosphere and service! Reasonably priced with an extensive menu for all ages and tastes. The Weber Starter Sampler was unbelievably good - hickory BBQ ribs just melt in your mouth. Grilled-fried pizza was out of this world and is a new favorite. Definitely will return for lunch and dinner in the future."
"Weber Grill Restaurant is my family's favorite "home away from home" when it comes to dining out. With $10 lunches the whole family can enjoy and live music in the evenings on a few nights, Weber Grill is what American dining should be all about. American steakhouses can be tricky places to prune a following for. Either the house must be so fancy that casual diners can be intimidated, or it risks coming off like a standby truckers' buffet with overdone steaks. Weber Grill Restaurant is neither of those. Even though I feel like I can go there for a special occasion, I also feel like I can just pop in for a laidback evening with my spouse or closest friends. I love the downtown Chicago location for Weber because I can make a night of it in Chicago. There is so much more to do before or after dining there. But, I enjoy the suburban location as well: particularly in Schaumburg, Illinois, close to where I live. All restaurants have the same warm decor and impressive dining rooms. There is never a problem gaining a reservation at Weber, even on busy weekends. The staff at Weber are real pros when it comes to serving meals fast without making patrons feel like they must rush. And, patrons are able to have the best cocktails at the bar while they wait. My favorite meal, of course, consists of Weber's famous steaks. They are among the best I have had. The meat is prime and often locally-sourced. But, even people who do not eat red meat or meat at all can find something at Weber. They have a formidable a la carte menu, fresh market rate seafood and a variety of soups and salads to choose from. If you haven't checked out Weber Grill Restaurant during your residency in Illinois or vacation to Chicago, do yourself a great service and add it to your list. I plan to keep Weber a part of my life for a long time."
"I was extremely happy with my first visit to Weber Grill. I had the Plank Grilled Chilean Sea Bass and it was perfect. Their menu for lunch looks a good bit different from their dinner menu so I can't wait to come back and try it. Our server helped to make this a great all around experience. She helped us choose what to order, knew the menu well, and didn't but us too often or too little. All around, a great dining experience for me."
"My family and I very seldom have a chance to really get out and enjoy good restaurants as we mainly rely on home cooked meals 90% of the time. If we do, it's something quick and simple. There's nothing better than a great burger and I have to say that Mushroom Swiss burger was absolutely amazing to say the least. Being a cook myself, this was as if I'd made it myself and I am truly glad that we decided to stop and have lunch! We will definitely go back again."
"A great fulfilling meal from Joe's! My friend and I visited Joe's after hearing much praise about the restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately greeted upon and it did not take long for us to be seated and waited on. We started with calamari (a must-have!) and oysters. The seasoning on the calamari was just right and the sauce was a great complement. Then we ordered the crabs, which far exceeded my expectations. They were a good portion and were fresh and broiled to perfection. And of course, I can't forget dessert! I have such a sweet tooth, so I know a good dessert when I come across one, and I must say, their blueberry pie was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect way to end the perfect meal. Compliments to Joe's for their excellent food and service! Definitely will be recommending to others and returning!"
"Weber Grill is one of the best places I have ever eaten! I'm a repeat customer they have kept on-board with their business for almost two months now! I actually came upon this restaurant through a co-worker outing after work to Smokey Joe's Bar, which was a very fun experience. But I had noticed that it was also a restaurant so one day I figured I would try it out and have loved it ever since. Yes the food is a little pricey. But the service, environment and the food is worth what you're paying! Favorite food would definitely be their steak. I love the NY strip so very flavorful and delicious! Definitely would recommend as a good bar or restaurant!"
"Weber Grill Restaurant has it all! From the delicious food to the daily drink specials and live music on Friday nights to the friendly staff, you will not be dissatisfied. The Grilled Oysters Rockefeller was the perfect entree and I'm still thinking about the steak I ate... I will definitely return!"
"The Weber Grill Restaurant is one of our families favorite weekend outings. They cook everything from delicious Sea Bass (my wife's favorite) to 18 oz. N.Y. Strip steaks (my favorite), all prepared on a traditional Weber grill. They also have a kids menu that my children love. The staff is amazing and have great insight on the menu. They also offer an impressive wine menu with variety like no other. And if you are on one of those no gluten diets they have an "out of this world" menu to cater to you with burgers, salads, ribs, seafood, and much more. They also have a fully stocked bar that has a warm and friendly atmosphere. All in all this restaurant impresses on many levels. Iv recommended them to family, friends, and clients. Keep up the good work Weber Grill Restaurant."
"Satisfying All Around I had dinner at Gibsons last Thursday and can't say enough good things about this place. I eat here at least once a month and they never disappoint. When we arrived for dinner we did not have a reservation, but we were greeted right away by an effecient hostess who led us directly to the patio. I guess being a group of only two we lucked out and got to sit outside. Our waiter was fast and friendly, he chatted with us a bit, but was not too overwhelming. My steak, as always, was cooked to perfection and my guest enjoyed his as well. Great food, great staff and great patio- I will be back again during this summer!"
"I visited the Chicago branch of Gibsons Bar & Seakhouse, I was very pleased with nearly thanks aspect. The servers were friendly and quick, atmosphere was quite, which I enjoyed very much and best of all the New York Sirloin was to die for. I would give the Chicago branch a 4/5, its a must go if you live in the area."
"My girlfriend and I came to Gibsons for our anniversary dinner and were delighted at the food, ambiance, and service. To start with - while pricey, the steak is well worth it. There are a variety of portions (all huge) and styles. The feel of the restaurant it classy/dressy - we wanted a nice place to celebrate and this fit the bill perfectly. The service was delightful - fast, courteous, and with good wine recommendations (a necessity for this beer drinker!). If you still have room, the desserts are to die for. An added bonus - convenient valet service out front. Five stars! The perfect fancy date place!"
"Ah, Gibsons. Where do I begin? I began the day weeping gently in my cheap hotel room, desperately eating a Klondike bar, trying to fill the hole in my soul. After waking up at noon from a drug and alcohol induced coma, I wandered over to Gibson's, where I found the greatest steak I have ever eaten. Perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, yet not too rare. The seasonings were excellent. As I sat down in this delicately lit, perfectly equipped with ambient music, I felt myself re-inflate mentally. I ordered quickly and quietly, avoiding the server's respectful downward gaze by using one of my own. When my Tanqueray and Tonic arrived, it was excellent: Genuine Tanqueray, about 50-50 tonic and Tanqueray, extra lime jsut how I like it. As I was half through my drink, the steak arrived with fresh, crisp veggies (steamed, not boiled) and moist mashed potatoes with a generous splash of gravy over them. As I picked up my knife and fork, I almost felt human again. At the end of my meal and my drink, I felt certainly human, and ready for another night with "Frank" and "The Director" as Phil Collins plays in the background. Until this shoot is done, I will be coming back here - nightly."
"I recently went to Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse in the Chicago area, and had an absolutely wonderful dining experience. I was seated promptly and the host was very friendly. My waitress came to my table rather quickly and told me about the specials of the day. I ordered a shrimp cocktail for an appetizer and it came out in a reasonable amount of time and was really delicious. The shrimp was seasoned perfectly and the cocktail sauce served was incredible. After my appetizer, I tried the New York Sirloin which was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. I ordered it medium-rare and the kitchen hit the mark perfectly. After a great dining experience at Gibsons, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for high quality food in the Chicago area. The prices were a little high, but the food is definitely worth it!"
"Best steak in Chicago! We started with the Crabmeat and Avocado, it was fresh and absolutely mouth watering. For dinner, I ordered the 10oz Filet Mignon, they also offer a 14oz. The steak was cooked perfectly, it was tender , juicy, and the flavor did not disappoint. We barely saved room for dessert but couldn't pass it up. We had be told how delicious there pies are and to try atleast one. Our server warned us about the massive portions, so we decided to split the macadamia turtle pie. It was to die for! It was the perfect balance of rich, creamy, and sweet. I was tempted to order one to go! We will definitely be back."
"It was my husbands birthday and we wanted to do something special. I let it be his choice and he selected Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse. While I have never been there, some of my friends have and they did nothing but rave about it. So off we went. They have a large selection of usda angus beef, which steak just happens to be my husbands favorite. While they are a bit pricy, they did live up to their name of generous portions. My husband had the Chicago Cut 22oz of pure beef. It was worth the pricey prize tag. I had the filet mignon 10oz, both steaks cooked to perfection. They also have plenty of apetizers. They had lobster, clams, and all the salads and soups to please all tastes. The service was devine. I felt like we were the only ones the waiter had to service. His name was Steve, and I would recommend sitting in his section, if given a choice. He made us feel real special. Like I said they have a full menu, chicken, king crab, tons of sides, very generous, I had lunch for the next day with all my left overs, even I have to admit, my husband for the first time ever actually had a doggie bag. I would recommend this restaurant and we will be visiting again, I assure you, I want to try it all."
"I went here for dinner on Fathers Day and I was really pleased with the special they offered. It included appetizer, main dish and even desert. I also thought it was cool how they sent my dad home with a free gift of Joes steak spice. My dad had a good time as well and the pricing was pretty descent. I definelty recommend this restaurant and I am sure ill be back too."
"My husband and I recently celebrated our 12th anniversary at the Rosemont location of Gibsons Bar and Steakhouse. This restaurant is much more elegant than anywhere we would normally go, so in spite of being excited, I was afraid we might feel out of place. This was a unnecessary worry however, and the exceptional staff made sure we were quite comfortable. We took advantage of the complimentary valet parking and were seated very quickly. We started our evening with a couple of their famous martinis...and yes they are quite large! For dinner I chose the Filet Mignon and my husband enjoyed a 13oz New York Sirloin. For desert we shared a divine chocolate hazelnut cake. The portions were very generous, the service impeccable and the food, heavenly. We will definitely be returning to Gibsons for our special occasions in the future."
"I have been to Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse several times, each time being a pleasant visit. They have vallet parking. The service was very good, we were waited on promptly and the food arrived in a timely manner. There was so much to choose from menu. The food was fantastic and the prices were comparable. All in all, I felt very favorable to this restaurant. I would, and have, recommended this place to friends and family."
"Looking for a nice date-night restaurant?...Gibson will fit the bill. It has a good, top drawer, classy-without-being-ostentatious atmosphere, lit in a quiet way that fosters intimate dining and an overall good vibe. (If you are there in the right time of year, add some oysters on the half shell as an appitizer, they are top quality, fresh, small and a real treat). My favorite steak order is their one pound "WR" sirloin...and you can depend on the fact that you will receive your steak rare/medium rare/-whatever/ EXACTLY the way you ask for it. The service is very good, the wait staff were attentive without being intrusive, and knowlegable about specific items I asked about, both bar and menu listings. A word of warning about the valet parking though...yes, it will be necessary, given the area...but with a charge of 14.00. (OK, I know this is supposed to be a fake review, but I really have had lovely evenings at the Gibson's in Rosemont)"
"I visited Gibsons for the first time today. I am from out of town and it is very rare to find restaurant quality like this. The food was amazing and extremely cost effective. I basically got 2 meals out of the one I paid for. My service was exceptional and the environment was clean and mostly quiet. Overall, this was a great experience."
"Gibsons is the kind of place you go for a really nice evening. You can tell they keep standards -- clean environment, professional severs, and nice presentation of the menu. They even keep standards of their guests: no men in sleeveless shirts. You might find it a turn-off, but I like that guests are encouraged to promote the overall swanky feel of the restaurant. When you're there, you're not just at some neighborhood grill or dive restaurant, you're having an elevated experience. And that's all not even to mention the food, which is amazing. I am a steak lover and I had the porterhouse, which was generously portioned and cooked absolutely perfectly. The texture was almost buttery it was so tender; I can honestly say I've never had a better cooked steak. But the perfection of the menu doesn't stop at the beef, something you might expect at a steakhouse. Not at Gibsons. My boyfriend doesn't eat red meat (too bad for him at such a restaurant!) and he had the roasted chicken, which was seriously just as buttery and amazing as my steak was. I found myself picking off his plate any scraps I could find when he wasn't looking. In short, the restaurant is everything you want from a nice night out. The service is prompt and attentive as well; we left a generous tip. We will definitely be back in the near future, it may be my new favorite spot for date night."
"Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse offered a wide variety of food on their menu. Scenery was excellent and the staff was polite. Food was great and the wait time was little. The bar offered a large variety of alcohol and the restaurant was very clean. Located in a convenient part of Chicago. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."
"Recently, I discovered an amazing Chicago restaurant, Gibson's Bar & Steakhouse. I had heard of this restaurant and its good reputation, but hadn't had the opportunity to check it out until now. Wow! I am now a huge fan. Not only were the portions generous, but all parts of the meal were done to perfection. My martini was much larger than usual. I also really appreciated the dress code...anything other than sleeveless shirts for men are permitted although many men were dressed in shirts and others in jeans. I found the valet parking especially important in downtown Chicago. I am now a huge fan of this unique and classy restaurant and can't wait for my next visit with that special someone."
"My husband and I are the parents of a young child and we finally got the chance to have a night away, so after a bit of coin tossing we decided to give Gibsons' a try. I have to say, the coin was in our favor! We did arrive at a popular time, but the wait was no more than you'd expect before we were seated, and we got drinks right away. The lobster cocktail may be the greatest thing I've ever eaten. Seriously? Try it, it's amazing! My husband is an absolute Prime Rib junkie and he's still talking about it. The prices seem on par, if not a little higher than our other favorite, Morton's..but in the end, we've definitely decided we'll be going back! Great service! Great food! Great experience all around!"
"Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse is a small restaurant in midtown Chicago with excellent food and a very comfortable and casual atmosphere. This being the first time I had eaten there, I decided to go all out. I ordered the New York Sirloin with a Double Baked Potato and House Salad. The food took a bit, but the wait was well worth it. My steak was cooked to perfection just as I had ordered it and everything tasted scrumptious. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I could not have asked for a better dining experience. I can't wait to visit again and try some more of their mouth-watering menu selections. I'll definitely be recommending Gibsons to all of my family and friends."
"My wife and I visited Gibsons for our anniversary dinner. It was our first time eating at the restaurant. We were able to make reservations through their website without having to call in. When we arrived at the restaurant we found that the only parking available was valet. I wouldn't have minded if the charge was fair, but the $14 fee before tip was a bit too much for my liking. Once we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was quick to take out drink order and bring over glasses of water. We both had the house wine, which was decent. A bit too dry for my taste, but drinkable. We ordered Filet Mignon as our appetizer. My wife had the 10oz, I had the 14oz. The steaks came out in a timely fashion and were cooked exactly as ordered. The meat itself was tender, flavorful without being overbearing. I enjoyed the garlic mashed potato sides and asparagus. The portions were large enough that would could not have even considered desert. Overall, the experience was positive. The food was good and worth the price. The valet parking was a bit too expensive, but the food and service more than made up for it.We would definitely return."
"If you're ever in the Chicago area, you MUST make a reservation (or several) to experience Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. Imagine that your taste buds are starving and Joe's is the Oasis to quench their thirst. Our party of 6 was swiftly seated once we all arrived. My friends had to drag me along with them since I wanted to stop and look at all the plaques and interesting decor along the way. It is always promising to be intrigued by the decor and feel at home by the staff. Our handsome waiter gave me the impression that he had been highly trained and was serious about making our time there the most memorable. The menu was quite extensive and the waiter was very patient with us going over the daily specials and helping us make our selections. While I was appalled that one of our party actually ordered a classic hamburger for $15.00, it arrived perfectly cooked to order and looked like it was prepared to be photographed on the cover of Bon Appetit Magazine. All of his menu selections seemed to be as close to his daily lifestyle and simple tastes, but the recipes for these culinary masterpieces seemed to surprise me at every turn, including the macaroni and cheese, as a side dish. He devoured it with enthusiasm and teased the rest of us that we were missing out on the best burger he's ever had. Each and everyone of us specifically chose a different portion of the menu to order from. We wanted the full experience and while most things were expensive for our budget, it was well worth the extra cost. We will be returning each and every opportunity that we are able. It was an eating experience we want to indulge in more."
"Gibsons Bar & Steakhouse. What can I say about them? Well, I guess I can start out by saying this is my new favorite restaurant. The food? Amazing. The staff? Very friendly and super helpful. The prices? Very reasonable. What more can you ask for from a restaurant? I asked for a New York Strip Steak, cooked medium rare, and guess what I got. Exactly that. Cooked perfectly, wonderfully sized portion, and tasted so good. I can't wait to go back, but I am not sure what I want to try next. Maybe a burger? Probably not. The steak was too good to ever pass up. I walked in and was immediately friendly and helpful. I got a table almost immediately. My waitress, Alice, started out by asking if I wanted to order some appetizers or drinks. She was very friendly and helpful without being overly-annoying or invasive. Needless to say, she got a nice tip. The food, though priced slightly high, was very reasonable when you consider the portion size, flavor, and speedy service. Overall this is an amazing place, and I 100% recommend you check it out. 4.5/5"
"Gibson's Bar and Steakhouse is awesome! The food was delicious, the wait staff was lovely and it was the best steak in chicago. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."
"My husband and I stumbled upon Gibson's by accident in downtown Chicago. You know how it is when you try a new place, is it really going to be worth the money? Well, it was, the food was amazing. The prime rib and double baked potato were amazing and we shared chocolate mousse for dessert. We definitely didn't leave hungry! It was a tad on the pricey side for us, but the food was so worth it and the service was top notch! I would definitely go back again."
"Girl and the Goat has a wonderful atmosphere! I felt very relaxed and had a great, private meal. The flavors were paired very well together and dishes were original. I'll be heading back soon!"
"I just tried Girl and the Goat for the first time and was blown away! When you first walk in you're greeted with friendly staff and long, wooden, family-style table seating. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the menu is filled with craft beers and and veggie/fish/meat entrees. Everything we ate was so fresh! We (my girlfriend and I) started with the roasted cauliflower. Pickled beets and peppers popped in your mouth with every bite! My girlfriend loved her scallops and charred pork belly was to die for. We will be back soon, because everything on the menu deserves to be tried at least once!"
"My wife and I ate here recently for our anniversary, and we thought the ambiance was lovely. I had the roasted pickles, which I have never had, and quite enjoyed the savory flavor. My wife chose the sauteed green beans which she thought were tasty and a healthy option. I also had the pan roasted halibut, which was cooked well, and the white asparagus served with it was flavored well and not bitter, compared to white asparagus I've had in the past. Their wine selection was quite good, and we shared a bottle of Endrizzi Chardonnay. Altogether, this was a pleasant dining experience and I would recommend it to others."
"Are you looking for a fun and tasteful new restaurant to try out? Girl & the Goat is the place to explore with your taste buds. The food is unique (in a good way) because they offer food variations that you normally don't see in a restaurant. My favorite combination would have to be Grilled Baby Octopus with a nice cold brew. Along with the great food quality comes with great customer service. Girl & the Goat as some of the nicest waitstaff a restaurant could ask for. They are not just trying to sell you food, but trying to make your experience at the restaurant that much better. If I had to rate this place, I would give it a 10 out of 10. This is a most place stop!"
"What can I say about Girl and the Goat? Every Chicagoian wants to get in here and eat at some point. I finally got my chance during my anniversary dinner, where my husband make reservations without me catching on! The restaurant was so warm and inviting and I even caught a glimpse of the chefs working as we were seated. The decor was amazing, and the selection of food was phemonimal. I order the crispy pork belly, and the hubby had some confited goat belly. The presentation was out of this world and so was the taste. I was in heaven. We left full, but not feeling fat. The food was rich without feeling like there was real weight to it. Such a great experience, I can't wait to go back!"
"Really enjoyed my experience here. First thing I noticed was the atmosphere. The decor created a very rustic and older feeling, which was very nice. The waitress was with us immediately taking our order, which was awesome as it was so fast. She was very polite and fast with our drink orders. They had an amazing collection of craft beers that fit our group perfectly, and we all sampled a couple different ones. We placed our food orders and enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. When the food came out it looked unbelievable. It was displayed extremely nice, and tasted even better. Overall, the experience was amazing and I recommend the Girl and the Goat to anyone who enjoys good food, rustic atmosphere, and craft beers. Thanks!"
"In a "foodie" town like Chicago, there is the hottest new restaurant about once a month. The Girl and the Goat deserves every one of the thousands of gushing accolades. It is a stunning combination of adventurous, luxurious taste sensations, combined with a fun atmosphere that makes every dinner seem like a party. I took a large group to dinner there this week and we all enetered as sort of uptight partial strangers and exited as best friends over the course of one of the most memorable meals I've had. The chef recommended a tasting menu of the restaurant "greatest hits" signature dishes ( oh my, the pigface! Oh my, the roasted goat leg !) and combined with the warm, funny attentions of our server Brendan ( who at the end of the evening was also considered to be a best friend), this meal was perfect! It is expensive, but worth every penny. If you are looking for dinner to be an event- don't walk- run to the Girl and the Goat!"
"Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. I consider myself to be a true foodie and I am consistently blown away by the quality of food and level of service at Joe's. It is truly what upscale dining should be. I have been to Joe's many times and have never had a bad experience. I look forward to many visits to Joe's in the future."
"I and several coworkers were in Chicago on business; after we closed the deal, the locals recommended this place (Girl and the Goat) when we asked for a good place to relax and celebrate. We decided to give it a try. The place is in the West Loop, glad we were using transit since parking would have been iffy. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but took that as a good sign, since the place was packed and busy. I checked out the menu on my phone while we waited, I liked that many of the entree listings include where the ingredients were sourced from, and links to read more about these places. Our server was friendly and fast, and the actual restaurant was comfortable and clean. It was obviously a very popular local place. We tried a few different craft beers, I had a Great Lakes Eliot Ness. Much better than having a Budweiser at a chain restaurant! Menu has vegetable, fish, or meat choices; we had the wood grilled broccoli, Skuna Bay salmon, and I had the crisp braised pork. Didn't take nearly as long as we expected, given how busy they were, and the food was fantastic! Great service, good booze and food, nice place, and the bill was very reasonable. We're definitely eating here again when in Chicago."
"Went to Girl and the Goat while visiting the Chicago area, and I can't thank who recommended it enough. Like the name would imply, it's not a typical restaurant. With such a great staff it has the atmosphere of having a meal with a bunch of best friends you just met. The staff was so much fun, and the food was great as well as the craft beers. I heard that all the produce (including the meat) is produced on local farms, so it is guaranteed to be fresh. Would highly recommend Girl and a Goat to anyone."
"I recently ate at the Girl & The Goat restaurant. I was hoping to find something unique, great tasting, and a great atmosphere and I found this place to have all three qualities. I had an awesome portion of sauteed green beans and an appetizer. I had an awesome goat loin dish for my mian course that was cooked to perfection and I can't wait to have that again. The strawberry parfait to top it off did not disappoint. I plan to try the oysters next time, it looked as though the couple at the next table was enjoying them. Their menu has plenty of variety to offer. I highly recommend this place for a date night but it also works for a casual dinner. I will be back!"
"After months of planning and putting off, I finally found myself seated at a table in Chicago's much talked about hot spot, Girl and the Goat. The restaurant is both elegant and eclectic at the same time creating a symphony for the senses even before the meal. I started out with the fried pickles I'd heard so much about, and let me tell you the accolades were not unfounded. Delightful little treats that had me eagerly wanting more. Now normally I'm all for a steak, but this night I was feeling quite bold, so throwing caution to the wind I ordered escargot Ravioli featured on the evenings menu. Although not sure what to expect, I have but one word, amazing! Chef Stephanie Izard is a true master of the culinary arts and deserves all the accolades she has received and more. Unfortunately my time was short and waist line was expanding so desert had to be skipped, but should I get back to Chicago, I can promise you Girl and the Goat will be a must stop on my list."
"We went to girl and the Goat to celebrate a birthday. We all loved the chickpea fritter appetizers and the wood grilled broccoli. The atmosphere is fun and casual. Service was fast and friendly. Our favorite entree was the delicious skuna bay salmon."
"I love the Girl & the Goat. I take my wife there at least twice every month and the food and drink is nothing but outstanding. We usually get the Belgian Ale, but we also love the wine and cocktails. The food menu offers a wide range of options, ranging from fried pickles to beef tongue. While we mostly stick to the drinks, we also love their fried oysters. Overall, I love the Girl & the Goat and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time with good food and drink."
"Very good veggie options. Wide range of selection. However, if you are looking for meat based on the name you will be sorely disappointed. Does not have very many traditional options but a decent variety of weirder items. Interesting atmosphere, good service."
"Yum! Such a great place to dine for a succulent and nicely priced meal! Not only was the food absolutely to die for, I had the green garlic potato wontons, but the atmosphere was nothing short from ideal. The service was incredibly friendly and the meal arrived very quickly. I give this place two thumbs up!"
"I just happened upon Girl and the Goat with my family and boy am I so glad that I did. It is a bit pricey but the food is totally worth it! The chickpea fritters are to die for. Its a great place to hang out with family. The service was good. Our waitress Ashley was hilarious. We will definitely be returning."
"Our dinner started with a warm set of olives. The tart and sweetness of the combined olives was superb. Next came the squash blossom rangoon. In which the almonds gave a good crunch. Our entre was a pan roasted halibut. The food was surprisingly wonderful and paired with the rustic feel of the resturaunt made for a wonderful experience. One I would like to repeat over and over."
"What a great place for surf and turf! My husband and I went to Joe's for our anniversary dinner last week. The atmosphere was fantastic, and the food presentation was gorgeous. The wine list is extensive and truly a delight for any connoisseur. The staff is friendly and professional. Truly sensational, a must have in the Chicago area. Oh, and the New York Strip is to die for!"
"I took my fiance to Girl & the Goat for his birthday recently, having heard rave reviews about the restaurant's craft beers and amazing entrees. We were not disappointed. The service was stellar, and the food was out of this world. The chef even made an appearance at our table to bring out dessert. By the way, the Miso Butterscotch Budino is divine. If you haven't tried it yet, get thee to Girl & the Goat at once."
"The atmosphere was really wonderful and I really appreciate how nice the servers were. They knew all the different types of beer and what each one tasted like. They were very helpful in recommending what to order. I like how the menu changes and it is not the same thing every time. I would be more than happy to recommend this restaurant to another friend. Once again, thanks for the spectacular service and food. Needless to say the beer was fantastic."
"The Girl and the Goat restaurant is easily one of my all time favorite places to eat. I absolutely love inviting a few friends out to have a good time and enjoy some awesome food. The atmosphere is very chic beautiful, just looking around the place is like having a blast! Personally, I highly recommend the green garlic potato wontons, they are so delicious and you'll want to take a few home for later! Between the food, the drinks and the place itself, you will quickly become a fan."
"My wife and I loved this restaurant. We had the Fumo Negli Occhi and granted it was a little small but filled us both up. What a great value this place is. I will be back when I'm around this area again."
"Chef John Coletta of Quartino (Chicago) has outdone himself. His curious and interesting selection of how to prepare dishes leave the taste buds satisfied, such as the Ravioli stuffed with braised pork, speck and fava beans. If you are a wine/cheese pairing novice, ask the staff to choose for you as their knowledge is quite in-depth. We were quite happy with the size of the portions - not too large, not too small. Also, the salad selections were varied and had something for everyone - from beets to naval oranges to walnuts and house-made burrata. Lastly, the ambience of the restaurant is refreshing and not stuffy as sometimes places can be when they offer a truly upscale menu. We recommend, if there's room, sitting out on the charming and cozy patio deck overlooking the street. It's a great way to people watch and get some fresh air, while enjoying a spectacular meal!"
"I've been to Quartino's several times for several different occasions for both business and leisure. Quartino's staff always knows how to tend to my needs perfectly--they are always very helpful and very knowledgeable about the daily specials and menu items. I loved the vintage decor throughout the restaurant and their great selection of wines. The thing I love most about this place is the option of choosing the shared menu where two people can eat a three meal course for a very reasonable price. They have valet parking which is always a plus and serve both individuals and large groups. You can book reservations directly on their website which is great because you can book on the go. I would definitely recommend the roasted calamari or salmon and my favorite pasta is the gnocchi. Chef Cotello is one amazing chef and his restaurant is by far one of the best in Chicago."
"recently I ate at a restaurant called Quartino an Italian restaurant. Upon arrival I noticed the outside was very well taken care of, the ground were well maintained and there was no litter on the ground. As I walked in the first thing I noticed was the smell of cleanliness and good food. the hostess greeted me promptly even though it was busy and told me the wait time would be about 20-30 minutes but told me could have a seat at the bar where I was offered o complimentary glass of wine. The wait time was accurate as I was seated 25 minutes later. The server greeted me right away and took my drink order. He returned with in 10 minutes with my drink, and a basket of fresh bread and butter. Upon his return he started telling me about the specials they were offering that night. I placed my order and was served with in 15 minutes. All in all I had a very wonderful experience at Quartino. The service was outstanding, the staff was efficient and courteous, the restrooms were well stocked and clean. I will be returning there in the future and will be telling my friends and family that I highly recommend this fine dining experience."
"I always look forward to business trips to Chicago, because I know I will have the opportunity to be swept away to Italy - at least in a culinary and dining atmosphere sense - when I dine at Quartino Ristorante and Wine Bar on North State Street in downtown Chicago! I know that I can drop the worries of the day and indulge in the yummy and beautifully presented regional specialties they offer. The ambience at Quartino is always warm and welcoming, and the staff is always helpful and dedicated to providing excellent service. As for the food...on my 3 visits to Quartino, I have never found a dish I didn't like. If I had to pick my two favorites, they would be the crispy calamari with organic tomato sauce and the organic veal skirt steak, served with wild arugula, roasted grape tomatoes, and balsamic syrup. Chef Coletta and his team have put together such a sumptuous menu that limiting myself to two favorites is nearly impossible. Everything has been delicious. The prices are very reasonable, the food is fabulous, and the service is always above and beyond expectations. I would definitely recommend Quartino if you are ever in downtown Chicago."
"For a moment I thought I was in Rome, it was Monday and I was visiting Chicago for Business. At lunchtime my Business partner recommended the Quartino. I could not think of a better choice. The wine was half price on Mondays, so we considered that we were in the right place at the right time. The Quartino presented the best of Italian traditional mouth-watering fare. It was difficult to choose from the many option because everything smelled so good. I had that sense of nostalgia as I glanced at the menu. The Artisanal Alumi, Neopolitan thin-crust pizza, house made Pizza brought back special memories of my 3-day trip to Rome. The first time I had eaten Artisanal Alumi was in Rome. Chef Colletta did an excellent job! Fine dining, excellent wine and authentic Italian atmosphere is the feeling you get when you walk in. As you walk in you are greeted by the effervescent personality, Chef John Colletta. He is famous for transporting the culture of Rome to the bustling city of Chicago. We needed to talk business so we were able to enjoy the private dining that they offered. The Waitress said 'Bon Apetiti' and we sat down to an enjoyable Business 3 course lunch special for $25. Yum! What a treat"
"The first time that my husband and I came to dine at Quartino, was for our Saturday date night.We pick a different restaurant to check out on the last Saturday of every month. This time we had decided on finding something delightful in the downtown area of Chicago. I had heard great things about Quartino's menu from friends and we are both always very eager to try new places, especially because we both love Italian food so much. We are both pretty good cooks, and we loved getting inspired by eating out. On our first night dinning at Quartino's I decided that I would only try they vegetarian dishes while my husband would try a meat dish as a main menu, and we would share the appetizers. The restaurant was packed on Saturday night, brimming with lively chatter and a mixture of delicious aromas. We felt immediately at ease as we were seated by our served. We started off with the white bean and garlic spread, the chilled zucchini and polenta fries which we had to order a second round of! They were absolutely incredible! We also ended up finishing a bottle of delicious Itlaian wine with dinner. I had the mouthwatering, homemade gnocchi and my husband had beef short ribs. We were both in heaven and I though I wanted to not eat meat, I had to try the short ribs, and they were well worth it! The ambiance was warm and welcoming, the food incredibly delicious and our check was very, very reasonable. Quartino has quickly become one of our favorite places to dine out in Chicago and we love sharing it with friends."
"Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab is an excellent place to dine for any occasion. Very authentic and delicious cuisine. Everything about the experience I received there was outstanding, from the ambiance, great service, and incredible on-trays. Great variety, great scenery, and great people. I was thoroughly satisfied with Joe's. I will be frequenting there often, and would recommend anyone else to do the same."
"I finally decided to try Quartino, a restaurant in downtown Chicago I had heard many good things about. I showed up at about 6pm on a Friday evening with a close friend, and after a short wait (it was busy!) was given a table on the outdoor patio. I was greeted by a waiter very quickly and we each ordered a glass of red wine off a pretty impressive wine list - I had a pinot and she had a cab. The menu is tapas style with MANY dishes to choose from and share with the table. We decided to order a couple small plates to share, and an entree each. We started with Duck Prosciutto and the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare, which is a mixture of octopus, shrimp and clams cooked in a tomato sauce - it was a bit more expensive but so worth it! We wanted to try something new and this was an incredible dish. Cooked well and seasoned perfectly. For our main course I got the Veal Osso Buco and she ordered the ravioli. My osso bucco was perfectly cooked - it tasted like it had been cooking all day! It was served with an herb based condiment that pair perfectly with the rich veal. I was told the ravioli (which was hand made in house) was tender and full pork goodness. It also contained speck, which I have never had but tried, and was very bright and floral. In a strange way, it worked perfectly with the pork and tomato sauce. After dinner, we were too full to order dessert, but I will definitely be returning - possibly for a digestif and an Italian dessert I've never had before? Despite being very busy, the service was attentive and the food was served hot. I have already recommended this place to my friends and will be returning several times in the future!"
"When I first walked into Quartino I was greatly surprised (in a good way!). I have been to many restaurants in the area and in Chicago in general but the atmosphere and presentation here jumped out at me. Something about it was so simplistic and comforting, I felt like a regular the first time I walked in. It made me want to return without having even tried the food! I was greeted by a host when I came in and was sat down at my table. The service was good. He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable, however the place was very busy so he was running around to serve his many tables (not his fault). I ended up deciding on the Margherita pizza. The ingredients tasted very very fresh. I'm not much of a pizza person myself, but I tried it at the recommendation of the next table over and was very glad I did. I boxed up the 2nd half of the pizza for dinner, I wanted to have room in my stomach to try at least one more thing. I went with the "Chilled Zucchini - Grilled with sun dried tomatos." accompanied by the wine of the month, a 2011 Rosado from Spain. I probably should have asked for help pairing the wine plates with an appropriate wine, the server gave me some great recommendations that I didn't take him up on. It was still very very tasty, and worked decently, but next time I'll be sure to take the servers advice. They are there for a reason! Overall my experience at Quartino was excellent! The food, service, and atmosphere all came together nicely for a very holistic experience. I would recommend this place to others, however I would say it is best with 2-4 people. I can't wait to take my out of town friends here. Four and a half out of five."
"I ordered the ravioli and the salmon, and I have to say, it was one of the best dinners I have had this year. The salmon was perfect, and the pork inside the raviolis was something I've never had before, but will be getting again. Prices may be a tiny bit high for some people, but it is well worth it for the quality of food they serve. I would recommend Quartino to anyone, and have recommended already to my family members. Very, very good restaurant."
"Having heard the rants and raves of fellow co-workers, I decided to head on over to Chicago's own Quartino for lunch - I had heard that for the price, you could not beat the quality of service and the tantalizing flavors presented to you. As I walked in, I was greeted by a warm, professional, but welcoming face. After finding out I had no reservations, I was assured I would have a seat within minutes. To my delight, I was given a table for two on the patio. The sun was shining, the gentle drone of the city seemed to fade away and I began to understand Quartino's charm from the get go! Within a matter of minutes, an intelligent and delightful waiter came to introduce himself to me, as well as answer any questions I had about their wonderful and extensive wine selection. They didn't have my favorite wine, but when I inquired, he quickly pointed me to a wine he was convinced I would love! He didn't disappoint. I was delighted. After my drink arrived, I explained that I was short on time and that I had come to sample their lunch special, 3 course meal. He was quick to make a few suggestions, as he could tell I was the adventurous sort - or as some would say - unable to decide. Having loved his wine recommendation, I trusted this gentleman with my meal choices as well: "Let's see what he's made of," I said to myself. The first course was a presentation of a Roasted Beet Salad. I'm usually pretty reserved about Beets, but I was determined to expand my horizons and to allow my waiter to guide me though. I was delighted when I found a crunch in my salad, Walnuts. So often these salads are one dimensional in texture - leaving you a bit wanting, but this time I was pleasantly surprised. An excellent paring with the sweetness of the roasted beets. On to the next course, with a clean plate! Next to arrive at my quaint table on the patio, was Duck Prosciutto. When you and I typically think of Prosciutto, we think of pig, so of course, I was skeptical. My conscience was soon eased by the light gaminess of the duck. I had worried that it would be too gamey for me; however, the seasoning pulled out the more poultry aspects of the duck and my mouth was left watering - 'Compliments to the Chef!' Wanting to end on a light note, I requested my third course be a soup. He offered his Sun-Dried Tomato Soup. I was weary. Sun-Dried Tomato usually seems pretty rich and deep, almost acidic in flavor - a bowl full of that sounded like a nightmare. When the dish came out though, with the expected basil I was met with a pleasant added surprise - Ricotta Crostini. This gem added a unique twist to my childhood "Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup." And that is exactly what it was, an adult version of my childhood favorite. Not too rich, or acidic - absolutely delightful. I finished up with enough time to take a small stroll through the restaurant and explore their bar - perhaps that will be my next venture! For now, I left full, satisfied and returned to work another one of those ranting and raving Quartino junkies. Service? Flawless. Food? Decadent and Delightful. General Feel? Exciting, but welcoming - like a family gathering in Italy!"
"I love coming to Quartino for dinner! The house-made pasta dishes are really delicious, especially the tagliatelle (my favourite). The prices are reasonable, and you get a lot of food for your money. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town."
"My husband and I ate at Quartino's this past weekend. Although we were dissapointed that there were no available tables outide on the patio; I absolutely loved the historical decor on the inside of the resaurant. We shared the Soprano pizze, it was amazing! We can't wait to take my husband's parents there when they are in town next month. If the weather allows hopefully we will get to enjoy a patio table."
"I visited this restaurant during a recent visited to Chicago. I was very happy with my margherita pizza, it had just the right amount of cheese and sauce and was nicely presented. My friend very much enjoyed her order of tortellini. The server was friendly and made us feel very welcome. We would definitely visit here again."
"My husband and I are regular customers at Quartino. We just love the atmosphere and friendly staff. It's a fine dining atmosphere with a family restaurant price. My husband tries something different every time we go (about twice a month) and so far has liked everything, but I'm stuck on the pizza Quattro Formaggi. Two thumbs up!"
"I love this place! It has that authentic, rustic Italian feel, in everything from the decor to the menu. The Veal Osso Bucco is probably my favorite dish here, and it's the best I've had anywhere. The lunch special is a great deal, too. Quartino is also a wonderful place to stop in and have some wine on the patio. Don't miss out on this one."
"Quartino is definitely one of our favorite restaurants. When the weather is nice, there is nothing better than sitting on the balcony. The wait staff always has a smile and very helpful. I never once had to ask for a refill on my drink, they were really on top of the service. The food was amazing. The menu has a lot of options for everyone to find something they like. We will be going back very soon."
"My overall impression of Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab was very positive. The restaurant's atmosphere was very active and lively which I seemed to enjoy. I have no problem whether if the restaurant is busy or not. The customers also seem to really enjoy the specials of the restaurant and the prime steak. The cook always does a good job so rarely customers bring up any problems. This restaurant does a fantastic job."
"Wow! My friends had been talking about Quartino's, but I had never been. I finally went last night with a couple of friends. I have definitely been missing out! The atmosphere is fun and exiting and the staff is friendly and go out of their way to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. The food? It was to die for. Perfection. Definitely a 5 star experience for me. I'll be back, and often!"
"All I have to say is WOW! after visiting Quartino in downtown Chicago. The menu was rustic and everything I tried I loved! As an olive aficionado, that was my favorite part! The service was speedy and professional. It's a good wait staff when you hardly know they're there unless they are helping you out specifically. We stopped by on a Tuesday, which was disappointing since my party wanted the half-off wine deal. Nevertheless, a GREAT experience at Quartino Chicago. I would go back in a heartbeat, or faster!"
"My husband and I decided to try Quartino for dinner one night recently while his parents and sister were visiting, and it was wonderful. The dining room was very open and had a lively atmosphere. The decor was vintage and cute, and the retuarant smells like heaven as soon as you walk in the door. The food was amazing, the tortellini was some of the best I've ever had, my husband kept trying to steal it off my plate! The menu even had some vegetarian options listed, which made my sister-in-law very happy. The staff was friendly and quick. It was a great night and my husband and I will definitely be coming back soon!"
"The Signature Room was just as classy as we expected, with the amazing skyline view that is literally second to none. I would have been perfectly fine just to sit there and enjoy the view, but the food was out of this world as well. I ordered the Petit Filet and it was cooked to perfection just how I ordered it. I'm no meat expert, but it must have been a great cut because it was the best steak I've had in a long time. I highly recommend this place to anyone either looking to impress or that simply has the highest standards of quality on their own."
"Wow. I had an incredible night at the Signature Room. Me and my boyfriend showed up 30 minutes late for out reservation, but the hostess was so nice! She gave us a table and didn't even mention our faux-pas. I got the halibut that was like heaven on a plate and my bf got the snapper. It was our three year anniversary and when our server Brian found out, he brought us two complimentary flutes of champagne and a free dessert. I mean, what? Best service ever. This place is incredibly expensive, but it's perfect for a special event."
"Recently i had the extreme pleasure of being able to eat out at The Signature Room at the 95th. While i don't tend to treat myself to often, I had heard great things about this restaurant from a coworker of mine and decided to try it. I can honestly say that it didn't just meet my expectations, it blew them out of the water. The view is one of the first things you notice, a spectacular skyline view of the city, especially gorgeous at night with all of the lights shining. The staff we're all very professional and polite, even giving me some great suggestions on what wine would go well with my dish. The menu was simple, clean, and elegant. The table sets were also rather pretty. While slightly on the pricey side, my Manhattan steak was cooked to a medium perfection, and my dinner experience was one of the best of my entire life. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in some premier dining."
"I visited the Signature Room this evening to enjoy a 10th anniversary dinner with my husband. I couldn't ask for a better view- the restaurant overlooks the city streets of Chicago. We were seated especially close to the gigantic, encompassing windows. I dined on the Grilled Tofu. I was especially pleased to see so many readily-made-vegan options. Many restaurants require you to call in advance if you have such strict dietary restrictions, but luckily (since I did not mention when calling), Signature Room's menu featured many vegetarian options, and a few vegan ones. The food was magnificent- beautiful, delicious, flavorful. I was a little reluctant to eat it, but only because I wanted to have my cake and eat it too! I would recommend this place for any special occasion."
"I went to The Signature Room at the 95th last Friday for a relaxing dinner for two with my girlfriend and was greeted with impeccable service and hospitality from the wait staff. We sat down and ordered an appetizer and an entree each. For the appetizer, we had the Duck Trio. The duck thigh was cooked perfectly, but the toast points were a bit soggy. They must have been sitting out for a few before coming to the table. Other than that very minor detail, the rest of the appetizer was fantastic. For dinner I had the rack of lamb while my girlfriend had the petit filet. My lamb was cook perfectly. The lamb was juicy and full of flavor and the sides complimented the lamb just beautifully. I didn't have the chance to try the petit fillet myself, but my girlfriend absolutely loved it. For dessert, we shared the passionfruit cheesecake. It was light and fluffy and the crust was amazing. I would definitely go back and eat there again."
"The Signature Room is an experience that is well worth your time. The ambient atmosphere is astounding. The view is breathtaking. The food is superb although a bit pricey. Customer satisfaction seems to be the key word here. The staff go out of their way to insure that you have a pleasant and memorable dining experience."
"I would rate this restaurant a 4 out of 5. I went here for a romantic dinner last week with my wife. The view is breathtaking, and the food is just as spectacular. We started our night off with the Grilled Shrimp appetizer. Simply amazing. I then ordered the Wagyu Manhattan Strip Steak and my wife ordered the Petit Filet. We both enjoyed our meal, and found it to be quite a delicious experience. Oh, and I forgot to mention the service. Boy, these people sure are friendly. And they're quick too. I would definitely go to this restaurant again for a special occasion. Thank you Signature Room at the 95th for this lovely experience!"
"I absolutely love Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab! The first time I went there was with my friend who invited me and I can't get enough of it ever since. The restaurant itself is very elegant but the atmosphere is still very laid back and enjoyable. The food is delicious. My favorite dish is the Filet Mignon. You really do get a bang for your buck at this place because not only is the great but the service is also excellent and fast."
"My husband and I treated ourselves to an intimate dinner date at the Signature Room to celebrate our wedding anniversary. What a treat it was. I had the Lamb, and my husband the Veal. We also added a side of vegetables. The food was delicious; fresh wonderfully flavored, cooked to perfection and served with a creative flair. The portions left us satiated, so much so we had to force ourselves to share a dessert. The staff helped us pair our meal with complimenting wines. We felt like royalty sitting atop the John Hancock Center looking over the lights of the city. I don't hesitate to recommend The Signature Room for any special occasion and look forward to our next excuse to dine there. We noted on the menu that the restaurant supports a different charity each month!"
"My husband and I recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at The Signature Room at the 95th. We made a reservation weeks in advance using their online reservation tool. The process was incredibly easy and user friendly. We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early and were greeted by a very friendly and respectful hostess. She showed us our table, a private affair in the back corner of the facility. The table settings were beautiful and the overall atmosphere was elegant and exactly what we were looking for. The hostess gave us our menus and politely informed us who our server would be that evening. Our server was a well dressed young man who was polite and articulate. He made a few suggestions on what to choose and helped us with wine pairings. After ordering, he respectfully left us alone. It was lovely to spend time with my husband in such a formal atmosphere, it made our evening something very memorable. When presented with our food I was very impressed with how beautiful the presentation was! It was stunning, so artfully plated, I almost did not want to eat it! The taste and quality of the food can not be compared to anything I've had before. It was delicious! The suggested wine paired wonderfully with the dish as well. Our night went better than I could have hoped. The staff and food at The Signature Room at the 95th met and exceeded my expectations! five stars!"
"Oh my goodness i love love love this restaurant and have told everyone i know about my experience. The decor is beautiful and the view left me speechless. And the dessert was to die for i had their Passion fruit cheesecake and fell in love.This is a place I can spend hours at."
"Last night was my boyfriend and I's second anniversary, and I knew he would do something special for it. He brought me to The Signature Room at the 95th, which I've always wanted to check out, but have never felt I had the time! We were greeted in a prompt and genuinely friendly manner upon approaching, and ushered to a window seat with an incredible view in the blink of an eye. We had arrived just in time for brunch, which is my favorite meal of the day. After inspecting our options, I settled on the Brie and Pear Quiche, while my boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict. We ordered coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice to enjoy while we waited, and they came quickly. The juice did indeed taste fresh, and the coffee was hot and one of the best cups I've had in a long time. Our breakfast arrived in a reasonable time frame, and everything was better than expected. The staff were friendly and efficient, making sure we had everything we needed without overly hovering. My favorite part was discovering they have a focus on sustainability, buy their meats locally, and give back to the community through philanthropic endeavors. I'd give this restaurant 5 out of 5 stars, hands down, and plan to return frequently in the future."
"This Chicago restaurant is a diamond in the rough. My husband and I went to the Signature Room for brunch one Sunday after recommendations from a friend. I had the steak and eggs which was delicious. It was moist and cooked to perfection. My husband had the buttermilk pancakes, which I tasted from his plate. They were fluffy and delicious. I knew what I was ordering for our next brunch. As for the atmosphere, the ambiance is very sophisticated, a classy affair. Wait time is as to be expected for a gem as this. I would definitely go again!"
"My experience while at the Signature room was very pleasant. The dining service was excellent and the view from atop the tower was amazing. The best part was the elegance of the environment. I do wish to return again because of the positive experience I had."
"My husband and I love coming to the Signature room at the 95th. It has a wonderful atmosphere of professionalism and it's a great place for one to celebrate a number of occasions. The food is wonderful and beautiful. The Twin Lobster Tails are to die for! I recommend trying that if you haven't. The staff is extremely polite, courteous and just wonderful. This is a must if you're visiting the area."
"On Saturday, June 15,2013 My friends and i had the pleasure of visiting "The Signature Room At The 95th." The restraunt is reminiscant of a scene you would see out of a 40"s gangster movie,with its silk table cloths, fine crystal wine glasses, and fresh cut roses on every table. The Signature Room At The 95 Th has an equally classic menu from hand cut steaks, to more intricate stuffed fillet mignon, to simple desserts, to flombe there is something on the menu to appease even the most finicky of pallets.I ordered a steak medium rare, with a greek salad and chose a cabernet sauvignon from italy from the extensive windlist, that features italian and german red and white wines.The signature Room at the 95th, features classic entrees with a diversisified selection of wine , sure to appease everyone on a Saturday night,when the only question im hungey, where do we go? The answer of course is The Sigature Room At the 95th."
"As a new customer visiting "The Signature Room at the 95th" I must say that I am not only thrilled with the experience, but also extremely happy with the high level of service I received. The floor to ceiling windows that allowed us to view the Chicago skyline was absolutely gorgeous, I feel lucky to have had this experience! The amount of variety on the menu is exquisite, and the pricing was not as high as I expected! I was shocked! A semi-reasonably priced, delicious, clean, well-mannered restaurant! I have been raving to all of my friends and family about this restaurant, and we are planning a family trip to visit not only Chicago, but this restaurant as well! I highly recommend this restaurant, although if you're afraid of heights I would ask for a table further away from the windows! It could be intimidating to those with issues with height!"
"I took my wife to The Signature Room for our 10th anniversary dinner after hearing great reviews from a friend who dined here at a wedding reception. Turns out his recommendation was spot on! We were stunned by the views of the city and even more impressed by the service. The staff went out of their way to treat my wife like a queen after I tipped them off that it was our anniversary which made our night even more special. While the atmosphere alone was worth the trip, I can't review The Signature without mentioning the food! My beef filet was delicious and the oysters are the best we've found yet in Chicago. If you're deciding between side dishes, I HIGHLY recommend trying the black truffle potatoes. After sampling mine my wife wished she had decided to splurge and get some of her own instead of opting for a more standard vegetable dish. To sum up: If you are looking for a place to celebrate a special event with loved ones or friends, I think that The Signature is a top-notch restaurant choice that will undoubtedly do your celebration justice."
"Me and my wife ate at Joe's last weekend and the service was the best we've ever had. We ordered the crab legs and the the ribeye, and I must say that my steak was cooked to perfection and the crab legs were great. We definitely will be returning to this restaurant in the near future."
"If you want something a little better than Joe's Crabshack, try Joe's Seafood, Prime steak & stone crab. The dining area and service was excellent with well dressed staff, who were all very polite. The prices might seem a little high but the amount and quality of food is worth it. All types of fresh seafood and great steaks are served in a variety of dishes that come full of deliciousness. With such a wide selection and great meals Joe's seafood is definitely worth checking out."
"I was recently in Chicago for a convention. A friend recommended that I visit The Signature Room At The 95th.It is probably one of the best recommendations a person has ever given me. The Signature Room At The 95th is an amazing restaurant it overlooks the city of Chicago. I ordered the Spiced Duck Breast for dinner the dish was mouthwatering and had an authentic taste. I also ordered a glass of wine to go with the dish. The food and the view of Chicago added to the moment, it was spectacular. The overall feel and environment of the restaurant is luxurious, the waiters and waitresses are friendly and both knowledgeable. I recommend The Signature Room At The 95th to anyone seeking the best of Chicago."
"I highly recommend The Signature Room for any visitor to Chicago. It gives you a great view of the entire surrounding city. The drinks are a bit pricey, but you're mostly paying for the view & atmosphere, which is fairly upscale. It is a chill lounge which is relatively quiet and a great place to chat or hang out after dinner. The line can get long, but it moves at a decent speed."
"The Signature Room is on the 95th floor of the John Hancock Building, and although I'm not one for heights, I soon forgot about that, looking down at the bright lights of Chicago. The restaurant is comfortable and cozy with it's wood decor, and the service was fast and friendly, the restaurant being family-owned. I ordered the Filet of Beef, which was worth every penny ($50) and was made even more mouth-watering by the side dish of Roasted Mushrooms and Truffles Vinaigrette I ordered($5). The potato galette, wild greens salad, and oxtail pot-au-feu that came with the steak was really something to remember, and went well with the fine bottle of Beaujolais. (My mother was a waitress for 35 years, and I could find nothing to complain about, and always leave a 15% tip.) This is a great place to bring a date or larger party to make an impression not soon forgotten!"
"I love Joe's Seafood. I am a seafood enthusiast and have been to every seafood restaurant in the Chicago area, and Joe's is the best by a longshot! Their seafood is fresh and always tastes like it was just pulled from the ocean. Their dishes compliment the seafood perfectly and taste as if it were served by Posiden himself, haha! But really, it's the best. Their prices are more then fair for the quality of food and service you receive at Joe's. Everytime I have company visiting me I take them to Joe's and they always agree with me that it's the best seafood they have ever tasted!"
"We went to Mike Ditka's - Chicago restaurant. It was great. My husband got the sushi and I got crab cakes. They were both very good. The restaurant was also very clean. We will be going back to the restaurant soon to try out their other food."
"For Fathers day I received a gift card to Ditka's, a restaurant owned by former Chicago Bears Head Coach Mike Ditka. I was excited to try it out and went last night. I made a reservation for the Chicago location through the website (this was very easy to do). When we got there I immediately took notice of the decor, which was very visually appealing to me. Service was quick to take our orders. I got the Alaskan Halibut, my wife the Lake Perch. Both arrived to our table quickly. The portions were large and I had to get a too go bag! We were so full we decided to skip dessert. The prices were fair. Overall I would rate the place an 8/10 and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family."
"Ditka's restaurant was a delightful experience. The entrance to this restaurant was very inviting and the staff welcomed us with a smiled.The servers are professional and worked in a timely matter to receive our orders. The menus had clear images that were enticing to my appetite. I ordered the BBQ baby back ribs that were mouth watering. They were falling off the bone. They were sweet and tender. Cooked to perfection. My side order of spinach salad was a fresh delight. It contained crunchy bacon and slices of egg, and sweet slices of apples. The ambiance in this restaurant was great,subtle music playing in the back ground, people laughing and conversing.The food was delicious and service outstanding with servers always checking in to see if we needed anything. A great experience and will be coming back again."
"Being a big football Chicago Bears, my friends and I decided to go to Mike Ditka's - Chicago. Wow, we were amazed by this place! We went and had dinner at 8:00pm on a Friday night, I called and made reservations ahead of time. We started with drinks, I am a big fan of Moscow Mule's. This one did not disappoint me at all! The server was great, from drinks to dinner she was very helpful! We started appetizers with the Calamari, and for the first time I had it Rhode Island Style. I cant say that I'm a big fan of this, but it was great to try something new. I then had the prime meatloaf stack, being from the south I love meatloaf! This was so good, that I had to take a picture and post it on Facebook...YUM! Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well. All and all this was a 5/5 experience, and I will differently come back!"
"Ditka's in Chicago has certainly impressed me. Usually when I take the time to write a review its because I am extremely unhappy. The food was nearly inedible, the wait staff spilled a drink on my wife "accidentally" or the roach in the potatoes was the only thing appetizing. None of this happened at Ditka`s in Chicago. It never will happen either as the food is of the highest quality. I had Dry-Aged Angus Prime Rib with Mike's Fries. I wanted the most All American meal I could order and that was it. I wolfed it down like William Perry circa 1985 and I will say it was the greatest piece of meat I have ever had in my life. The potatoes were like a touchdown in my mouth with every bite. Ditka`s is truly the Super Bowl of food and the winner is you. I wish I had saved room for Overtime as I imagine their dessert is as good as the entree. I will definitely be back at the Goaline at Ditka`s for another Championship Dinner."
"Mike Ditka's restaurant in Chicago is amazing! My husband and I do not go out together all that often due to conflicting schedules but we decided on this place because of the atmosphere it portrayed and we were incredibly impressed. It is a beautiful place that makes you feel comfortable as soon as you walk in. It is clean and the smells were mouth watering. The staff was personable and greeted us with smiles which is something many service industries are lacking these days. We were seated without too much of a wait. Our waiter came to take our drink orders after only a minute or two and the drinks were ready right away. We ordered the fresh calamari to start. I am a HUGE calamari fan and this was some of the best I have had. It was hot, fresh, crispy and to die for. I would go back for that alone! I also had the spinach salad which had bacon and eggs and a delicious dressing. It was excellent and fresh. We shared the seafood platter which was plenty of food for the both of us after our appetizers and it was all so fresh I was shocked. Normally when you get seafood out it is hit or miss. Either it is fresh and wonderful or it isn't and it can break the whole experience. But Mike's is a place that a highly recommend for their exceptional service as well as their superb cuisine. We will certainly be going back! Our waiter got a great tip!"
"I recently went to Mike Ditka's - Chicago for dinner with friends, it was my first trip to the restaurant. Overall I enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the food was delicious and the waitstaff was courteous and friendly. I would recommend Mike Ditka's - Chicago to a friend. The atmosphere immediately caught my attention as I arrived. I am an avid sports fan, I found the restaurant's ambiance to be very exciting. There was a lot of very interesting pictures, posters and sports memorabilia decorating the restaurant. It's really any Chicago sports lover's dream! I was really impressed with the food. I had a Prime Filet Mignon with a loaded twice baked potato. The chef did a great job of cooking my steak exactly how I ordered it, medium rare. My meal was a little bit costly but the food itself was outstanding. Our waitress did a great job of getting my food out to me quickly so it did not end up sitting under a heat lamp for a long time drying out. If you are a sports fan and you enjoy steak, Mike Ditka's - Chicago is definitely a restaurant you will want to visit. I will be back to try some of the other delicious sounding items on the menu like the burgers, ribs and seafood. Despite the price, I was completely satisfied with my meal, it was worth every penny. I am looking forward to my next visit to Mike Ditka's - Chicago."
"I recently went to Chicago to visit an old family friend who needed my help. While I was there, they suggested we go out to eat at Mike Ditka's. I was surprised at the speed with which we were helped. There was a small line, but we got our table extremely quickly, and were promptly greeted by our server. He suggested some specials, took our drink orders, and left us to peruse the menu. Shortly after we had decided, the waiter returned and gave us some complimentary bread, then took our orders. I had decided to order the Angus Prime Rib, and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon Two Ways. Our food came out much faster than I had expected, and was delicious! I had originally thought the price was steep for what I was getting, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the portion size was very generous. It would have been worth it for the flavor of the food alone. My steak was done to absolute perfection, the very definition of medium-rare. My friend's steak was likewise pristine. I got to try a bit of his order as well, and was again taken aback by how delicious it was. All in all, our experience was absolutely spectacular. I would give them 5/5 stars for service, cleanliness, helpfulness, flavor, and portion size. Unfortunately, I didn't see any desserts, which was a shame as I would have enjoyed getting to hang out a little longer in the warm, inviting environment of the restaurant. I will definitely be visiting again, and will be suggesting to anyone in the area: Visit Mike Ditka's, you will not be disappointed!"
"Joe's is my favorite place to relax after work. The bartender there makes great cocktails and when I get hungary, I like to have their classic cheeseburger at the bar. The seafood here is really good, especially the stone crabs. My wife likes the grilled tomatoes and Ahi Tuna, which has a wasabi kick. Service is fast and attentive, but the waiters also know how to let you be when you want. They don't hover. The decor is classic, but updated. . .dark wood, white linens, soft lighting and black and white photos on the wall. On weekends, this place really heats up, but I like to come on weeknights when it's less crowded."
"I had the luxury of dining with friends at Mike Ditka's in Chicago. Wow! What a place! You will surely want to make reservations just to make sure you're not left out. We did and there was no standing around when we got there. When you first walk in, the decor is truly amazing. We had a nicely set table in one area of the dining room. There are many different areas including some private rooms as well. Our waiter was superb! I really think he would have even cut our steaks for us. For starters, I had the Maryland crab cake. I am a crab cake-aholic, so I'm always looking for the best ones and I think I've found it. It was perfectly broiled with the best crab meat - no shells or cartilege in this one! Next, not being too adventurous, I ordered the chicken noodle soup. I told you I wasn't adventurous. How can you possibly make chicken soup any better? This is just like your grandma makes. Big chunks of real chicken, carrots, and celery were in this soup. For the entree, I love a good steak, so I ordered the Filet Mignon Two ways. One is done up Oscar-style with asparagus and bernaise sauce and the other was encrusted with horseradish around the edges. Ordering it medium was absolutely the way to go. The Oscar-style was phenomenal! The horseradish encrusted can stand on its own. A friend and I shared the fresh broccoli, which was perfectly cooked, not too crunchy and not too mushy. What an awesome meal we had. This was certainly worth the price, although in Chicago, this is a real bargain. I would highly recommend that you make Mike Ditka's your next night out!"
"My wife and I decided to try this place out as we pass by all the time but haven't ever gone in. Boy, are we glad we did! The service was excellent, the atmosphere was perfect, and the food was fantastic! Try the meatloaf stack, you'll love it."
"My boyfriend had been wanting to try Mike Ditka's for a while, so I finally agreed to go. The restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere. We didn't have to wait long to be given a table and our food arrived right away. I had the crispy tuna avacado roll, while my boyfriend had the prime ribs. The food was amazing! It was fresh and was well prepared. My boyfriend said his ribs were cooked perfectly. The meal was affordable and the whole experience was good. I definitely plan to come back."
"The service at Ditka's restaurant was not too fast or slow. I had the Iron Mike burger and it was AWESOME! One of the best burgers I have ever had. I was come back here for sure, just for the burger alone and hope to try some wine the next time I visit."
"All I can say is WOW! I went to this restaurant last week with some friends and I had such a wonderful time. The atmosphere was super comfortable and the wait staff was extremely friendly. The steak I ordered was cooked to perfection and all of the sides were wonderful! My friend's salmon plate smelled really tasty too. I just wish I could have tried everything on the menu ;) The priced were very reasonable too. I would definitely recommend Mike Ditka's to everyone. I cannot wait to return with more of my friends and family. - Clean - Friendly - Reasonably Priced - Fast Service - Perfect Food"
"i am not a person who normally writes review, but after going to this restaurant i cant stop myself from writing some words about it. quality of food and quick service are two main reason to recommend this restaurant to my friends. a good news is that they have some promotions also for drinks on sometimes, so you can enjoy your good food for little less value."
"I have gone to Mike Ditka's Chicago with a couple of friends and boy, didn't I imagine it would be more than a blast! I enjoyed the ambiance- it was friendly and at the same time classy. You cannot define the word class, but you can definitely go to one. They offer private dining, which is my next target visit. Once will never be enough for an outstanding experience."
"Wow! Mike Ditka's in Chicago is one of my favorite restaurants, it's seriously amazing. They have the best steak I've ever had, cooked to perfection and seasoned amazingly. I go to this place all the time, and every experience is incredible. The waiters and staff are all very nice, and are there to make sure that you have a great time. Their variety of meats are amazing, and almost every entree is on point. I personally love their steaks, but everything on the menu is good. I got to say, this place is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone."
"When I heard that Mike Ditka was opening a steakhouse, I knew I had to try it. The man is a legend in Chicago and is known for giving 100% to whatever he puts his time in. When I went in the restaurant I really liked what I saw. It was a very relaxed place, not too loud and not too quiet. The people and the staff were friendly as well so my initial impressions were good. But at the end it is all about the food. The steaks were great, my order was on time, and I had a really good time. I recommend anyone who likes good steak to check the place out!"
"I took my wife to dinner last Friday at Ditkaao>>s in Chicago. The place was busy, but the staff was on top of it and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server was friendly (sorry, I forgot her name) and had our drinks quickly. My wife had the Maryland Style Crab Cakes and she says they are the best she has ever had. I had the huge Ditka Cut Bone-in Angus Prime Rib. Not only was it big, but it had to be the best prime rib I've had in a very long time. The food and service rates a solid 10 while the atmosphere was closer to a 9. The prices are on the steep side, but it was well worth it."
"I had been to Joe's out in Vegas once before I came to Chicago, and was very fond of it. The Joe's in Chicago is one of the best restaurants I have been to in years. They featured a full wine list which included some great Merlot. My fiance and I started off with the '2nd Mortgage' featuring Alaskan King Crab, Shrimp and Scallops which was incredible. The Rib-eye steak I got for dinner was cooked to perfection and was rubbed with the perfect about of spices and pepper. I'm not one to 'lick my plate clean', but it was hard to put down my fork. Joe's is highly recommended and, if you can, save room for dessert, the Key-Lime pie was fantastic."
"I visited Mike Ditka's Chicago location the other night and was highly impressed with the restaurant. This location, in the Tremont hotel, has a great atmosphere and a very courteous staff. I went with a small group for dinner and we decided to try out several items on the menu to share. The Seafood Tower and Coach's Pot Roast Nachos were a big hit with our group. For my meal I got the Kobe Burger which was cooked as requested and very juicy. The side of fries I got was also good, though I was pretty full from all the rest of the food and didn't finish them. I would definitely visit Mike Ditka's again for the ambiance and the delicious food."
"My family of 4 visited Ditka's restaurant in Chicago for lunch for the first time, and we weren't disappointed. Although the establishment was busy, our wait for a table was minimal. Service was very prompt, which is a must when dining with kids! My husband and I found the lunch menu to be extensive and we were happy with the selection of beer. The salads were fresh and our burgers were prepared to our liking. Even our picky kids liked their food. And most importantly, when the bill came, we found our total to be reasonable, given the amount of food and drinks that we ordered. This is a great stop for tourists, and the next time we are in Chicago, we will be sure to stop in again!"
"The Purple Pig is by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The food and wine are amazing and the customer service is excellent. I will definitely be eating here again! Five Stars!!!"
"Very professional, inviting atmosphere. What struck me most about The Purple Pig was not necessarily its food, but the presentation. The food was great, but what really sold me on this restaurant was the way the owners and the employees presented themselves. Everybody with whom we interacted was very polite (some were quite sociable, and in a positive way), yet the decor and the architecture really painted an atmosphere of great energy and liveliness that fit the city around me."
"Great place, great environment, great service. I enjoyed my time at the Purple Pig and I will return soon. It may be cliche to say, but all of the wasted time spent at other restaurants is painful to think about. Being an adventurous soul, I ordered the Calamari. I have never tried it and The Purple Pig delivered. This was an attractive and appetizing plate with a taste that did not disappoint. The staff were helpful, prompt and proper. I will return again soon."
"What more can I possibly say but this: WOW! The Purple Pig was absolutely amazing! Very contemporary and modern styling was definitely on point. Selection of wines and cheeses were exactly what I expected. Prices were reasonable and were definitely not above the industry norm. Quiet, relaxing atmosphere. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and had sampled every dish to add to his knowledge. I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig to anyone!"
"I had read plenty about this restaurant in various restaurant reviews including Time Out Chicago and the Chicago Tribune. I was a bit hesitant because sometimes they never live up to the hype. But, I have to admit, the Purple Pig is really fantastic. First, the atmosphere is very tasteful, decorated with nice colors, and even the dishes are in the shape of pigs. The food was just fantastic. I was a bit overwhelmed by the choices of cheeses and wines, but our server was very knowledgeable and helped us to get match our wines with out meals and to choose some of the more popular dishes. I look forward to going back and trying some of the salads, which also looked amazing. And, when we left, we realized there is some outdoor seating for when the weather is good! Can't wait to return!"
"I went to the Purple Pig restaurant on friday night with my brother and his wife. It was their first time visiting Chicago so of course they wanted to eat somewhere downtown. I have to admit i'm not a big fan of charcuterie but on the advice of a friend we decided to try the Purple Pig, and I'm glad we did. Great and friendly staff who treat you like family from the minute you open the door(which is rare for a downtown restaurant). We were initially seated near the kitchen door, I then asked if we could have a table near the front window they switched us with no problems. The star of the night was the menu. For anyone who thinks this is just a pork restaurant think again. Huge selection of menu items for a variety of different tastes. I had the salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, and one of the best deviled eggs i have ever eaten. Our table had two excellent bottles of rioja wine. I would definitely recommend Purple Pig. Trust me, you will be pleasantly suprised."
"I had heard about The Purple Pig for a while and the chefs associated with it and wanted to try it out. Granted having the motto of "Cheese, Swine and Wine" didn't hurt! So I grabbed a friend and made plans. We decided to head over on Sunday afternoon to give it a test run. I had to start with the Pork Fried Almonds - how could anything fried with pork be bad. It wasn't. My friend loved the chorizo stuffed olives (the stuffing tasted great but I'm not an olive fan). I did swipe a taste of the deviled eggs and will definitely order them next time for myself. After some good conversation, I ordered the meatball sliders and my companion ordered the porchetta. It comes with salsa verde and she was really surprised at how much she liked the salsa. My meatball sliders were awesome on a taste scale. We both agreed that for some casual tastings, all the food impressed and we would definitely come back another time to try the fancier dishes."
"Eating at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab Restaurant is an outstanding dinner. The wait staff are all at the top of their game remembering every little detail we requested with ease. The Spinach Stuffed Mushroom Caps were a definite restaurant specialty on the appetizer menu. We absolutely had to try the Stone Crabs that the restaurant is known for, and were delighted with the quality and freshness. They made a great addition to the Filet Mignon which was juicy and tender and seared to perfection. To top it all off we shared a Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge sauce for dessert and were delighted with rich taste! A definite go-to on our list!"
"If your making a trip to Chicago, definitely make a stop at the Purple Pig. Not only was the food delicious, but our wait staff was super nice and friendly. They didn't make me feel like a tourist, they made me feel at home. Absolute must visit!"
"Purple pig's employees are awesome! (5 star service). Menu is diverse and everything tastes great! Ambiance is fantastic. It is a place where you can bring your love ones and friends. I will definitely recommend and come back soon."
"The Purple Pig in Chicago is located in a beautiful location downtown near the river and proves to be one of the premier dining locations in the city. Upon arriving at the Purple Pig, we were greeted by the hostess and immediately brought to our table. At first glance, the menu is overwhelming with a large variety of fantastic sounding dishes. For an appetizer we decided on the calamari and it was delicious. The calamari were fried perfectly leading to a crisp and crunchy texture and a nice, juicy flavor. The fregula and radishes that came on the side were a nice touch. I then decided to order wine from the vast and exotic wine list with a selection that is sure to please all wine connoisseurs. It was then time to order dinner which was difficult with all the different menu options. I decided on the meatball slider with Parmesan and arugula and it was to die for. The meatballs were tender and succulent with a great flavor. The marinara was also done well as it was just slightly sweet and of the perfect texture. The rolls on which the sliders came on were fresh baked and toasted to a nice crisp. For desert, it had to be Grandma D's chocolate cake which was, like the rest of the meal, delicious. The cake was moist and full of flavor and was a perfect ending to an excellent meal. Overall I would give The Purple Pig four stars out of four with great service, great food, and a great wine list. It is pricey, but the quality of the food reflects the prices an then some. It is now one of my favorites in the Chicago area."
"Anyone who has traveled will agree that finding suitable cuisine is nearly always a challenge. Big cities, such as Chicago, have a wide variety of different restaurants and diners all of which promising a unique dining experience. My family and I had heard about the classy restaurant named The Purple Pig from friends that had traveled there on business trips. The interior was beautifully decorated as was the outside of the restaurant. The hostess was very gracious as was the waitress, going above and beyond to ensure that our needs were met completely. Our food came out in a very timely manner. I ordered the Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic. It was absolutely exquisite. The meat was so tender that it melted in your mouth with a unique spin. My husband and I had white wine, so smooth that it just glided down our throats. We will definitely be back the next time that we are in Chicago and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a thrill of the taste buds."
"I have been to this restaurant, it is one of my most favorite restaurant, I like their Porch Etta Panini, this restaurant is one of the best maker's of delicious recipes of Pork. They have vide varieties of Mediterranean foods. I also like their roasted bone-marrow. I think this is one of the delicious restaurant for Pork Specialties. They are the Expertise of attracting the customers with their highly expert hospitality. I would definitely recommend and also take my friends there for the weekend parties."
"Where do I start? The Purple Pig is absolutely incredible seems about right. I first went with a couple of coworkers for dinner on a Friday night and felt as if I stumbled upon a gold mine. Its location is perfect for taking a client or a date. The Good Stuff: - The food is delicious. I have yet to try something I did not like. - The "plating" is done with great care and is incredibly appealing. - The wait staff is professional with the perfect amount of friendliness. - Dessert! Unbelievable! Don't skip dessert! The bad: - What do I write? I have yet to find anything bad! The Purple Pig is awesome. Try it. You'll understand."
"I started my evening out with an appetizer. I went with the broccoli with roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette. It had the perfect amount of flavor and balance. I ended my night with Pork Tripe Ala Parmigiana with Pork Skin Breadcrumbs. I was recommended this dish and it delivered. The pork tripe was cooked to perfection which bares repeating because it is easily messed up. The service was great, our server was very helpful and accommodating."
"What a great find! I went to this restaurant with my hubby yesterday and was totally satisfied. The decor was whimsical and fun. The wine list was extensive and the wait staff knowledgable about it. And the food...it was really amazing. We had the chorizo stuffed olives, which were savory and delicious, along with an assortment of cured meats and cheeses the waiter suggested. Then, we shared the clams. They were sooo good, especially sopping up the juices with the rustic bread. I really wanted to try the lemon panna cotta, but I was so full it just wasn't an option. I will definitely get it the next time I go, though, which will be very soon!"
"My wife and I decided to eat at The Purple Pig the other night, since one of my friends suggested it to me. Our first impression as we entered the restaurant was how beautiful the interior looked. The atmosphere was definitely fit for a date night with a significant other. The restaurant had a variety of wine to choose from. I chose a bottle of red wine from Spain but do not remember what it was called. My wife and I enjoyed it but that was just the beginning. The food there was amazing to say the least. My wife ordered the slow roasted ham panini and she said it was the best panini she had ever tasted. I had always enjoyed Mediterranean food and luckily it was the restaurant's specialty. I had the chicken thigh kebabs with fried smash potatoes and it did not disappoint. The price was reasonable and the food was off the charts. Although the service was average, I had nothing to complain about. I would definitely recommend The Purple Pig to my friends. Good food, great wine, a 10 out of 10 in my book."
"I was very impressed with The Purple Pig. The food was delicious, we had Antipasti, with Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary & Garlic which melted in your mouth. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys eating good food in a great restaurant. The service was excellent, fast and friendly and the price was just right. You won't be sorry that you stopped at "The Purple Pig" to eat!"
"My Wife and I just got home from the most romantic and great tasting dinner I have had in many years. We went to Joe's Seafood. The atmosphere there was out of this world and the service was top notch. We were greeted and seated really quickly. When I made the reservation, It was quick and easy. They took our drink order immediately and we received our Sweat tea's with 5 mins. We then Ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. We both ordered the Fathers Day special. The taste was out of this world and we had leftovers to take home. The server always seemed concerned with how we were doing and our drinks were always full. This place has great service, Great food and I love the atmosphere."
"When I arrived at the restaurant I was immediately surprised by how good the smell and the lighting was. I ordered the NV Nicolas Feuillatte Brut which was very nice and priced fairly.The server was very courteous and catered to all my our needs. I would definitely go back again!"
"I decided to treat myself to something special. I'd heard my friends talk about and decided to grab the wife and finally check out The Purple Pig. We arrived at 6pm, trying to beat the dinner rush. Luckily there was plenty of room and we did not have to wait. Antonio was our server for the evening. His uniform was clean and well fitted. We shared the kale and romaine caesar salad to start. It was good and the anchovy did not overpower the rest of the dish. However my wife was not the biggest fan of the quail egg. For entree I had the olive-oil poached tuna and it was amazing. My wife had the ham and mushroom panini but only ate half. I of course finished it right up for her! Neither of us had wine(had to work in the morning) so I can't really comment there, though the wine list did look rather extensive. We paid for our dinner and as we were leaving Antonio said good night and invited us back in again. The place was clean, the staff friendly, and most importantly the food was good. We just might take Antonio up on that invitation."
"I stopped in at the Purple Pig for lunch today, and had a great experience. The staff members were really friendly, and the food was terrific. This was my first time stopping at this restaurant, and I was really impressed with both the service and the food. I ordered the Meatball Slider with Parmesan & Arugula, and also treated myself to dessert (Affogato, which is soft ice cream with espresso over it). My slider was prepared perfectly, and the espresso was great (not too bitter). The prices were reasonable for the quality of the food. I definitely plan to go back, and soon!"
"We go to Shaw's sometimes for lunch. Usually have chicken sandwich. Prices are a little high but the food makes up for it. Service is always fast and friendly. Don't know about diner but for lunch you cant go wrong here."
"Shaw's is definitely a neat place to grab a bite. I went right when they opened at 11:30 for lunch, and it was already wicked packed. Being from Boston I'm a huge fan of lobster rolls, and I really wanted to see if their rolls were good enough to stand up to MA's delights. Good news! The rolls were stuffed full of lobster (no skimping here) and had just the right amount of mayo to satisfy my craving. Fries were pretty good, and the service was lightning fast even though it was packed. I was only in the area for a conference, but if I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely stop by! Oh, and don't forget to try the pecan pie--totally worth it!"
"My husband and I had a very pleasant lunch at Shaw's yesterday. Upon our arrival, we were greeted with smiles and our reservation was located quickly. We were led to our table immediately and I was impressed at how clean and inviting the place was. Our order of Lobster Cocktails, Tuna Sushi/Asian Salad and the Crab Cake Burger was taken promptly. We sipped our drinks and enjoyed the quiet, upscale atmosphere while we waited. Before we knew it, our server was delivering our food. Unlike much of the seafood we have tried before, this was fresh and quite delicious! My salad was fresh as well. Overall, a delightful experience. We will be back often."
"Shaw's Crab House is a fantastic experience all-around. The service is excellent. Our waitress, Sandy or Sally, I can't remember, was extremely solicitous and seemed to magically appear any time we needed something. The food was delicious. I couldn't believe the amount of crab legs that were in an order! We had crab claws as an appetizer, and I did my famous crab claw routine to my daughter's embarrassment, but no one seemed to mind, management included, when I walked around the restaurant with crab claws dangling from my ears, nostrils, and mouth. Good sports. The atmosphere, too, is tremendously welcoming, and I love the fact that you can arm-wrestle the chef for a free meal. What a fun place! We'll be coming back for sure. I can't recommend Shaw's highly enough."
"My family and I heard some amazing things about Shaw's, so we decided to book a reservation and go out for a nice dinner together. We decided to go on a Saturday for dinner, and when we arrived the restaurant was bustling, but not chaotic. The hostess greeted us right away, and when we told her we had reservations we were immediately taken to our table that was already set up for us. The server greeted us right away and we placed an order for their Tuna Anaheim Tempura (highly recommended!) and wine. After a bit, we placed our orders for the main course, and it arrived promptly and hot and was absolutely delicious. Throughout the experience the wait staff were attentive, but not pushy, and the restaurant is beautiful and clean inside. I had a great experience, and highly recommend it!"
"I dined at Shaw's Crab House for the first time for Sunday Brunch last week, to celebrate a birthday. New to Chicago, I was looking for a place to get sea food done right, and I sure found it! Shaw's is fantastic! The ambiance is beautiful and welcoming, and makes you feel at home, as does the friendly staff. The brunch buffet was the best sea food buffet I have ever had. The selection was fantastic, and everything was cooked perfectly. The Alaskan King Crab Legs were the king of my plate, but I think I tried a little of everything. I am just glad they didn't have to roll me out of the restaurant! They also have a cold sea food bar, an omelet and waffle station, and breakfast cocktails. At $55 per person, Shaw's Crab House is a little on the pricey side. But for special occasions when you want to celebrate, it is worth it!"
"Shaw's Crab House- Chicago is anything but "Crabby". The whole staff from the hostess to the chef were extremely friendly and made my dining experience one to be remembered. There whole menu looked extremely appetizing, but I finally decided to start with the lobster cocktail. It was amazing, the cilantro chile sauce really gave it a nice, refreshing kick. I then opted for the parmesan crusted chicken. Again, it was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the breading was crunchy on the outside and the chicken was juicy on the inside. As far as the sauteed spinach..well let's just say I couldn't get enough of it! I don't know how I did it, but I ordered dessert as well. Shaw's Raspberry Pie! The raspberries tasted like they were fresh out of the garden. This restaurant will definitely get my business again!"
"Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab was amazing! First off, because I had never visited before and was only visiting Chicago as well, I wanted to check the menu online. I was not disappointed! Their full menu was available, with descriptions of each item. I tried the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms as an appetizer and the Seared Ahi Tuna Sandwich as my entree and was not disappointed! Both were delicious and cooked to perfection. The service was also fantastic. I received my food quickly and it was correct on the first try (something I never take for granted) and our waitress was courteous and attentive. It's like she knew I was thirsty before I did! Overall, I recommend this place to anyone in the area. It is well worth a try."
"Shaw's Crab House is a new restaurant in Chicago that I would highly recommend to satisfy your next craving for a great seafood dinner. Last Friday night, I spotted the website at www.shawscrabhouse.com online, and was impressed with their tempting menu, the virtual tour, and the ease of making an online reservation. We arrived at Shaw's at 7:00 for dinner. The restaurant was crowded, but our reservation got us seated by a window within 5 minutes. The atmosphere is casual, and decorated in a pleasant decor with lots of beautiful wood and interesting marine art. The waiter arrived quickly and was friendly and knowledgeable. We all ordered the Alaskan Red Crab dinner, and our mouths watered as we enjoyed the succulent flavors. The entire meal was fresh, eye appealing and delicious. The cost was fair and well deserved. We all agreed that we would return to Shaw's Crab House again very soon."
"If you're looking for the best seafood in Chicago, you have to go to Shaw's Crab House. The menu of items is endless and almost overwhelming. Not only does restaurant offer traditional seafood dishes and appetizers, but they also have an incredible sushi menu to choose from and to satisfy any seafood craving. The lobster, avocado and cucumber roll is my favorite. As for the rest of the menu, I've tried the Broiled Lake Michigan Whitefish and Grilled Alaskan Halibut and loved them both, and would easily recommend them to anyone. I would definitely order each again, but with so many plates to choose from, I also want to try them all. There are also non-seafood options if you're going out with people who do not prefer seafood, but honestly this place is best enjoyed by those who love seafood. The atmosphere is also incredible and so is the wait staff. You will surely have an incredible time at Shaw's and I would easily give the restaurant a 5/5."
"Shaw's Crab House in Chicago is the perfect place to visit when you have a hankering for fresh, delicious seafood. Located just a few blocks from Chicago Harbor, Shaw's provides world-class dining in an upscale environment. I wore a jeans skirt and a nice top, and felt totally comfortable there. So it's not so fancy that you feel uncomfortable. Since I live in Chicago, I often show off the city to out-of-town friends over lunch. I usually suggest the hand-rolled maki (the spicy shrimp with salmon and lemon is the best!). For dinner, I like to order up a dozen half-shell oysters. Given the quality and the portion sizes, you'll find that It won't bust your budget. Another of my favorites is the authentic Broiled Lake Michigan Whitefish with the horseradish crust is another treat - and, again, it's reasonably priced. I also recommend checking out the sustainable seafood menu, which provides several selections you'll feed good about eating. I was too full to order dessert the last time I ate there, and I wish now that I had saved room. They have the BEST key lime pie, which I always love after eating sushi. Make sure you call ahead for a reservation. The restaurant is quite popular."
"As a big fan of seafood, I've been dying to find a great but affordable seafood place in Chicago. Upon recommendation from a friend, I tried Shaw's Crab House -- and was definitely glad I did! The items on the menu are well within my budget... which means they should be well within anyone's budget! The quality of the service is excellent; my server was friendly and I didn't have to wait long at all. Factor that in with the quality of the food, and it goes without saying that I've been won over! I implore anyone looking for some excellent seafood without wanting to break the bank to check out Shaw's -- hopefully you'll be as surprised as I was."
"I'm a big fan of seafood restaurants and this one did not disappoint. Everything from their sushi to their entrees is great - even the desserts are good! Great affordable place to take the family and it won't break your budget. Will definitely come back to this place."
"Whether you are tourist looking to venture the Chicago nightlife, or an elegant seafood joint, Shaw's Crab House brings you the best of both worlds. Located near the Chicago Harbor, the restaurant is found near beautiful Chicago seaside. With a menu that ranges from soups, steaks, crab, and the best oysters in town, there is no better place to dine quality food at an unbeatable price. Born in the San Francisco Bay Area, i have had my fair share of seafood a the piers, but, I can easily say that it feels good to have great tasting seafood out on the east coast.Thank you Shaw's Crab House for the great experience and will definitely return next time i come to the windy city."
"The most incredible seafood dishes are to be had at Shaw's. I love that they even serve sushi. Prices are well worth the visit and Sunday brunch is definitely worth checking out! Once you try a locally brewed coffee, you will never want to drink any other kind of coffee. Plus, the prices are less than a lot of other places that serve coffee blends."
"Shaws Crabhouse had an excellent atmosphere and was just a cozy place. The waiter was nice and prompt getting our orders. I ordered the spider roll and my girlfriend ordered the battered alaskan halibut tacos. The sushi was very good and flavorful and my girlfriend really liked the fish tacos, they were savory and just plain good. I would recommend a seafood lover here anytime."
"Shaw's Crab House is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. If you have family in town make sure and impress them by taking them to Shaw's. If you like Seafood Shaw's has it all, fresh oysters, crabs, and Sushi. Shaw's also has the best brunch in town. I love going during Sunday Brunch. The brunch is all buffet style and includes, eggs benedict, omelets, and fresh seafood. Come back for dinner and enjoy some of the best tuna in town. If you haven't tried Shaw's than you are missing out."
"Interested in some surf and turf? Check out Shaw's Crab House on E. Hubbard St. in Chicago. Their vast menu displays the quality of the items that they serve. My dinner consisted of sushi, twin lobster tails, and a glass of red wine to wash it down. The lobster tasted like it was caught out of the ocean minutes before it entered my mouth. Shaw's also serves as a perfect spot to take that special person out. The gorgeous dining room and selection of fresh cuisine will be sure to impress your date."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. Although I have been eating snow and king crab my whole life, I had never tried stone crab before and was eager to. I started with the spinach stuffed mushrooms, and they were perfectly cooked- moist and well seasoned. I tried some of my husband's cole slaw, and will definitely order that on my next visit as well. The stone crabs were amazing! Since I hadn't tried them before, I decided to go for the medium size stone crabs. The light seasonings went very well with the delicious natural flavor of these unique crabs. My husband had the new york strip steak which was cooked to his order (rare! Not my style.) He said it was juicy and very full of flavor. We enjoyed an excellent dinner, and I cannot wait to find another reason to "celebrate" and head back here."
"I love Shaw's. I go there all the time with friends and family. It is so good! I am always pleased with the service I receive, and the food is terrific. There is so much to choose from (large menu). The food is always fresh and delicious. Their dessert menu is outstanding, too. The location is quite convenient. If you're looking for a classy seafood restaurant in a great location in Chicago, then Shaw's is the place. I would highly recommend. Go for lunch and try the Parmesan Crusted George's Bank Haddock - it's to die for!"
"Shaw's Crab House was just what my girlfriend and I were looking for for our anniversary. They have everything here from seafood, to steak, to brunch. We entered the restaurant and were kindly greeted by the hostess who quickly took us to a very nice table. They even brought us a bottle of wine on the house because it was our anniversary! The waiter was prompt and polite. My girlfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the yellowtail snapper. Both were fantastic! For dessert we ordered the triple layer chocolate cake which was a perfect end to a great dinner. 5/5 We will definitely be coming back again!"
"I really liked eating here. They have the best crabs in town and they are the best type of quality. They make sure to boil the crabs and serve them at the exact right temperature. The way that they prepare the food is also different from many other restaurants. They make sure to only use the finest ingredients and make it taste good. I really loved this place because they also had great customer service. The people that served us were very friendly and they made sure to talk to us. They talked to me and my kid which made me very happy. Overall it is a great family restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone!"
"I ate at Frontera Grill & Topolobampo for the first time the other night. It was by far some of the best Mexican food I have eaten in a while. To start, the chips and salsa was excellent. The salsa was spicy, but not to spicy and the chips were warm. Then they brought out my tacos. The meat and beans were cooked to perfection. The veggies were juicy and flavorful. I was so full from my main coarse that I couldn't even fathom having dessert, but it looked delicious and I'll be sure to save room for next time. This was a great dining experience. The servers were very friendly and the food was brought out in a timely manner. The atmosphere was very authentic and appealing. This was a very family friendly restaurant. I highly recommend Frontera Grill & Topolobampo. 5/5 Stars!"
"The Frontera Grill & Topolobampo restaurant is a very refreshing place. The customer service was outstanding, they treated my husband and I with respect,and always checked on us. The food was superb , and we loved the fact that the food was very fresh."
"Rating: 4.5/5 I have been to Xoco a couple of times and loved it, but this was my first trip to the 'Original' of the Bayless empire. Me, my wife, and another couple. Waited for 30 minutes on a Wednesday night, but that's what we'd been told to expect so no bigs. Drinks while we waited, always a plus! We are all guacamole junkies so got the grilled chive version. Super fragrant and piquant, it was just what we were looking for. Ran out of chips too fast but the waiter was on it. Our friends split the tortilla soup which smelled and looked great. Another round of drinks; I got the 'Gold Rush' which was good and stiff but sweeter than I like. The wife got one of the margaritas which she considered pretty much perfect. I switched to cerveza after that so I would be able to remember the main course. I got the duck in jamaican mole (Mexican restaurant, I know, I panicked when he came to take our order). Duck was super flavorful and you could tell they put some work into the mole. The sides were good but hard to remember next to the main dish. I devoured it and almost got mad when my wife asked for a bite. She got the pibil special, a roast pig in banana leaves. It looked a little crazy but tasted awesome. Our friends got an enchilada and carne asada, looked great but I didn't try it; the portions are generous and filling, and I had my own work cut out for me. Only complaints: got pretty loud, but it was also pretty busy so go figure. Tables were a little small, especially with all the different plates and sauces. And after we turned down dessert (too full!) the waiter never offered another drink, but really that was fine as we'd all had a few. He was probably looking out for us. So a couple of minor missteps on ambience (really minor) and one tiny complaint about my drink, thus the subtraction of a .5 star. Hey they can't all be perfect. Everything else was excellent IMO. Definitely not a stop in on a whim kind of place, but I'm already planning what to get when we get a chance to go back!"
"I recently moved from Austin to Chicago about 6 months ago and I was starting to really miss some good ol' tex mex food. A friend and I found Frontera online with some good reviews so we decided to give it a shot. That was probably the best decision I made all week. The wait staff was very friendly and everything we ordered came out quickly. I got the carbon tacos and they were delicious. Exactly what I needed to bring be back home for an evening."
"I went to Fonter with my wife for lunch. The atmosphere and service were both amazing. We weren't quite sure what to expect beforehand, but, we were very happy once we went there. It's a nice cozy place, where you can sit back and enjoy a meal without being distracted by too many people. We started out with the fresh corn tamales, and let me tell you, they were amazing. We then went on to have the Tacos Al Carbon with steak. It was cooked perfectly and was honestly, probably the best steak taco I've ever had. If you do go, make sure you check out the homemade ice cream. Ben and jerry's has nothing on these guys. It goes perfectly with the chocolate pecan pie as well! If you are in the neighborhood, definitely check them out, we'll be back for sure!"
"I was pleasantly surprised to find such a fantastic restaurant in Chicago (okay, wasn't suprised, but was suprised on the quality due to the low cost!) ! My friend and I were working here for three weeks and stopped by on a rare night that we got off early. I had the lobster bisque, which was really incredible, and the arugula salad, which was good but not too heavy on the arugula (diluted with spinach, which was acceptable to me) and also a little too sweet. Overall it was tasty and filling however, for only $12. The wine was good and the service was excellent. I wish the beer list was more extensive. My friend got the Seafood Newburg and really loved it- I think I would probably get an entree instead of a salad next time despite the steep price increase. A little expensive but expected in the city."
"First time when I stepped into this restaurant, I felt upbeat! The atmosphere of this restaurant was very lively. I loved the music, the decoration, and most of all the waiter who served my table. He was very attentive and friendly although the restaurant was pretty busy at that time. Since I was still full from my late lunch, I decided to order just an entree called Carne Asada el Mole Negro (hope I spelled it right). It was quite pricey but absolutely delicious. My friend got herself Torta Ahogada. She let me have some, and again, it was very tasty and healthy too. While we were eating, the owner even came to our table and asked how do we like the food. Overall, this restaurant deserves 5 stars and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends because I am sure they will not be disappointed. I am now mouthwatering and thinking about going back to this place again tomorrow!"
"My boyfriend and I were on vacation in Chicago and, as always, were looking for a great restaurant to try out. After reading several reviews we decided to try out Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab. This worked very well for us because my boyfriend loves seafood and he doesn't get it often enough because I'm much more interested in steak. It's difficult to find a place that does both equally well but Joe's does it! Everything about our experience was amazing, starting when we walked into the restaurant. I loved the dark wood of the ceilings and the beautiful mahogany tables. The lighting was perfect to create a romantic dining experience for the two of us. After being seated we were greeted by a charming, friendly waiter dressed impeccably in black tie. He was extremely helpful in offering suggestions and very observant and prompt in making sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the bone in filet and my boyfriend ordered stone crab. The food was excellent; very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We both agreed that we would definitely eat at Joe's again the next time we visit Chicago."
"Honestly speaking this is the best and most delicious food I have ever had in the longest time. After moving into this new neighborhood I didn't really know any good places to eat. During a friendly conversation, my neighbor suggested me this place and I am so glad I spoke to him. Honestly, the food is amazing; they make it fresh, itao>>s clean and service is just wonderful. Unlike most restaurants the silver wear is actually spotless clean! I was highly impressed by the service, cleanliness and the quality of the food. One of the best foods I have ever had. I would highly-highly recommend this to everyone. You actually get what you pay for. It's affordable, it's healthy and it's amazing. You will love it, I know I did."
"What a find!!! While vacationing with my husband in Chicago over Father's Day (June 16, 2013), we decided to venture into new territory! We visited the Frontera Grill Diner. This is definitely a "award winning" establishment. The food was spectacular! I experienced the Frontera Grill Dinner - a "Live Fire Entree"! Garlic-marinated Gulf mahimahi, hoja santa crema (poblano, masa). Queso ai+-ejo mashed potatoes, arugula salad, spicy hoja santa tostada. It was the absolute BEST! Kudos to the staff, as well! Although the restaurant was busy, we were seated very quickly, and the waiter took very good care of us - he made us feel like we were his only patrons!! The only downside to the Frontera Grill Diner? Too many delicious things to choose from. It will take a lot of trips to try everything! We WILL BE BACK, Frontera!!! Cheers!!!"
"Fontera Grill is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. Simply stated, no other Mexican restaurant in the city can compare. They are always introducing new dishes to the menu, and I have never had a bad experience when eating there. Chef Bayless's talent seems to know no boundaries beyond the availability of fantastic seasonal ingredients in a place so distant from Mexico. It also seems that no matter what meal I eat there, I am always pleased with the dishes I receive. I especially love the Sunday Brunches, mostly because of the fantastic cocktails that are available. Like the food, these change with the seasons, but they are all wonderful and refreshing. The only problem I have with Fontera is that is can be hard to get into sometimes. They are no longer a Chicago secret (for good reason!) and you now have to have reservations weeks in advance for a Friday or Saturday night. Luckily, that is never a problem for me because I book a table every other week regardless! I would recommend Fontera to anyone who asked. Seriously, it's just that good."
"This place is awesome! I went here with my whole family for fathers day and it was the perfect place for us to go! The margaritas were delicious and the food was amazing! We will definitely be going back!"
"An evening at the Frontera Grill is a mini trip to Mexico. From the vibrant colors on the walls. to the festive sounding music that takes over the minute you walk in the door. The food, all made from farm fresh ingredients is all just right. The creamy guacamole is an excellent appetizer. The steak fahitas easily feeds two people. Their signature margarita makes you want to dance all night The atmosphere was nice. The food was good. You will find me there on many Friday nights"
"My boyfriend and I stopped by Frontera Grill the other night for dinner and were really pleased - it was overall a delicious experience and very reasonably priced. I started off with the blood orange margarita - incredible! Definitely a unqiue item, and I loved the flavor. My boyfriend had a rum and ginger cocktail which he said was very good. They also had the typical Mexican beers and a small selection of craft beers, which I will definitely be sampling next time. Since we are both fish lovers, we started out with the tropical tuna cocktail, which was sashimi grade tuna with an amazing tomatillo-based sauce and tangy salsa. And for the meal, we both got taquitos, which also came with a tomatillo-based sauce and guacamole. They were excellent (though I have loved every taquito I have ever eaten!) and came in a satisfyingly large portion. Best of all, the price was reasonable. The taquito entree is less than $10, so even though we had a great meal it did not hurt our wallets much. We had a great time here and really enjoyed our food, so I definitely will be back, and recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes high-quality Mexican food!"
"From the moment you walk into the Frontera Grill & Topolobampo you feel as if you are dining in quality. American food with a Mexican twist the food and service we had was top notch. Our service was fast accurate and courteous and the prices were very reasonable for such a nice selection. I coming back."
"We were absolutely blown away with our experience here last night. Upon arrival, we immediately knew that this was no ordinary Mexican place. The decor and staff was a step above anywhere else we have ever been. Our waiter was very kind and courteous. He helped us navigate the menu and gave us some great suggestions. We were a bit taken aback by the prices at first, but as soon as we tried our food, we knew exactly why. It was incredible! There wasn't a single item that we did not absolutely love. It's nice to have some authentic Mexican in the area now. We will definitely be back!"
"Frontera Grill is one of my favorite places to go to for a night out or even lunch. If you are there for lunch make certain you try the "Mexico City-Style Quesadillas," an affordable and delicious meal that will keep your tastebuds begging for more. The wide variety of foods and drinks makes Frontera an amazing place to bring friends, family, colleagues, or children. Four stars all the way."
"I have heard good things about Rick Bayless, as my best friend loves the Bravo show "Top Chef Masters". When I learned that he was opening a restaurant near my home in Chicago, I was intrigued, and my friend, who lives in Minneapolis, begged me to go on her behalf. I went during my lunch break, since I hate crowds. The atmosphere was great-- it was definetely based on real cafi(c)s in Mexico, and had just the right amount of trendiness to make it fun, but not hipsteresque. The bartenders looked like masters of their craft, as I saw other guests order difficult-to-make cocktails and drinks. And the mixers had no problem doing so. The waitress I had, Kathleen, was wonderful, and she gave me enough time to make my choice. As I looked at the menu, the first thing that caught my eye was Frontera's commitment to organic food. I've always preferred that to the standard supermarket fare, as it is healthier, fresher and (above all) tastier. I usually cook at home because there are so few organic restaurants here in Chicago, but I was very excited to discover that this one was! Now, I won't have to clean as many plates or pans, since I can eat here! After gazing the menu's wide selection, I settled on oysters with a side of black kale. I love both, and never have the former, since quality oysters are so hard to find at supermarkets. After Kathleen delivered them, I was intringued by this Latin take on a New England tradition, being from Boston. And I was amazed! The limes enhanced the oysters much better than any lemon could, and eating them with the garlic-chipotle salsa made a delightful entree heavenly. All the flavors combined to accent the smooth taste of the oysters, and they did so in perfect harmony. The kale was also delightful. I love this vegetable, as it is so flavorful, unlike many vegetables, and so healthy. I love it cooked in olive oil, but Frontera's addition of grilled onions made it unbelievable. The strong taste of the kale, with the fresh flavor of the onions was a spectacular marriage-- and it certainly is one made by Rick, one of the best matachmakers in the culinary world. In all, I was very impressed by Frontera and by Rick's cooking skills. My friend was right: Rick has great recipes and skill, and his dishes are healthy, and friendly to the Earth. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves good food-- and social responsibility, too."
