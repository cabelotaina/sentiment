"Abortions should be legal. I think that women have the right to choose what to do with their own bodies. A government should not interfere with how a woman deals with her pregnancy. Only she knows the truth behind the conception--- there could be birth defects, maybe she was raped or had an incestuous relationship. She should be able to decide if she wants to terminate her pregnancy.; 1
"Abortion, in the United States, should be a basic right to all women. Women should have the right to do with their bodies what they see fit. As long as the fetus would not be viable outside of the mother's body, it is not a living child. Until the time that the fetus can be considered a living child, the mother's rights should always come before the rights of the fetus. Religious beliefs are many and varied, but should not play a role in whether or not abortion is legal. There are a variety of reasons a woman might choose to terminate the pregnancy, and there should be nothing to stop her from doing so. If abortion is illegal, a woman who wants to terminate a pregnancy will still do so, but most likely in a more dangerous way, causing injury to herself in the process.; 1
"I consider myself reasonable pro-choice. I believe abortion is a nesscessary evil. I don't think having an abortion is to be ashamed of, but it's definitely nothing to be proud of. Abortion isn't entirely 'nice', but the lives of unwanted kids can be horrific, with a resentful mother/family, dodgy care system, many opportunities for all kinds of abuse. Militant pro-choicers are just as much as an annoyance as militant pro-lifers.; 1
"I am not sure about my exact stance on abortion. I never really gave it that much thought. I know people who have had abortions and I do not judge them as bad people. It perhaps is better to avoid bringing an unwanted child into the world, although it is true that the embryo is possibly a human and we cannot be sure of the suffering that it will experience due to being killed. Now that I am thinking about this I think that perhaps it would be better on the whole that people should really think long and hard and only go through with this in extreme circumstances. It could be argued that this is murder. We are not free to treat our children in anyway we see fit. they are not our possesions.; 1
"unless the woman is at risk for any serious complications. Also, abortion is killing a child in my opinion. But, of course, if its a child we are talking about to have an abortion because of a rape, then I would think that abortion is the answer.; 1
"Thou shalt not kill. An unborn baby should not be killed. The soul enters the mother's body at the time of conception. So when you abort your baby, you are killing, murdering, a human being. This is wrong. Period. If you do it, you have become a murderer. Why would you want to kill a human being? You will suffer much regret and remorse for doing so. So, please do not do it.; 1
"I believe abortion is not an option. Once a life has been conceived, it is precious. No one has the right to decide to end it. Life begins at conception, because without conception, there is no life.; 1
"I believe a woman should have the right to choose to have an abortion. There are many different circumstances that could cause a woman to want or need an abortion. If the pregnancy will jeopardize the woman's physical health abortion would be a choice she might need to be available. If the woman was a victim of rape and becomes pregnant abortion should definitely be a choice she should have available. I do however think that the time frame of when a woman can have an abortion should be change. I think an early abortion or first trimester abortion would be the ideal. If the fetus is viable or in the second trimester I don't believe that a doctor should perform and abortion.; 1
"" To tell the truth I believe abortion can be a very complicated issue about which people can be very passionate about. That being said, ""fundamentally"" (pun intended), I believe abortion is wrong because at the moment of conception the embryo has all of it's genetic make up that forms a living human being, regardless of what has developed of the child's body; and an abortion is ending that life which under normal circumstances would be born. But to make such a hard and fast moral rule about this isn't what I'd practice in real life. I'd say abortion should never be used as a form of birth control, but there are situations I'm unsure about how I feel concerning abortion. Say if a woman is raped or if having a child would endanger her life, these are just some of the tricky moral dilemmas in dealing with this issue that I can't say what I'd do honestly if confronted with in real life. "; 1
"I believe that women should have the right to get an abortin. Women who have been raped certainly don't want to carry the rapist's child, and they should absolutely have the right to terminate the pregnancy. If a woman knows that she is not going to love that child or be able to take care of it at all, it's best that the child isn't brought into this harsh world in the frist place. Although adoption is an option, it's still a hasty and long process. It is also unfair to make a woman carry a baby for 9 months, and potentially endanger herself if she is not even willing to take care of the baby. Most women have millions of eggs, and taking one away while it is still a tiny sac isn't probably going to do much harm. Also, to bring more and more babies in this world will only add to the amount of children in non-permanent foster care being bounced around from house to house or living their whole lives without real parents. Ultimately, it should be women's choice, as long as the fetus is 4 months and under.; 1
"Abortion is the loss of a human fetus from the mother. Whether the loss of the fetus is at 1 week after conception or 8 months, if done purposefully it should be treated the same. I believe women should have the right to have an abortion, but if they do, they should be educated to take responsibility the next time they encounter the situation. Abortion is a serious topic, and unfortunately, not enough take it seriously.; 1
"I have always suported abortion,For the sole purpose That a woman Has the right to choose what happens in her life and body. Thier are sercomstances to all decitions .Weather it be rape, incest, finances or danger of her life. I think everyone should mind thier own business,and try to focus on thier own tuff decitions in thier lives.Do not judge and turn thier other cheek in the other direction.; 1
"Sometimes in life we are presented with challenges. These challenges can come in the form of very difficult decisions. One of those decisions maybe whether or not to have an abortion. This decision should not be taken lightly but there are many good reasons why you should have the choice to do so. One of those is the horrible instance of rape. The other is an inconvenient pregnancy.; 1
"While abortion is a relatively simple medical procedure, there are complicated ethical issues surrounding it, and it is wrong to approach the topic with absolutism. In general, it should be avoided since it is irreversible, except when the life of the mother is in danger. On the other hand, it is wrong to force a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term - this is clearly involuntary servitude. Until there are more medical alternatives available, even elective abortion should be permitted, though alternatives should be provided and encouraged.; 1
"I think abortion is a good thing. I think that it is better to abort a child that your not ready for than raise it unprepared. I also think it is a good thing for teens that have been raped and are not ready for a child. Or just so that there is less babies in trash cans and buried in back yards.; 1
"I believe that abortion is nothing short of murder. There is only one possible reason for a person to get an abortion and this if the pregnancy is due to rape. There are many couples striving to get pregnant and give a child a good home and if you have an unwanted pregnancy adoption is the best choice. Every child deserves a chance at life.; 1
"I believe that in certain circumstances abortion should be legal. Imagine a young girl of thirteen getting raped, or even making the mistake of getting pregnant. Her body is not properly formed to be able to carry a child. Not only would the pregnancy be difficult, in most cases, the delivery would be traumatic. This would put both mother and baby at a high risk. In the case of a pregnancy of such a young person being raped, it could halt the healing of the victim if she were forced to carry the baby to full term. She would also always carry the scars in the form of stretch marks to remind her of the rape.; 1
"Life begins at conception. From the moment the DNA of two parents combines, a new entity, unique from all others, has come into existence. It does not gain an irreparable right to exist until it implants - thus beginning a chance to be born. Thus women who use the pill or contraception aren't committing a crime or sin - only those who end a naturally occurring pregnancy have ended a potential human life. And with so many families eager to adopt a child, healthy or not, all children are wanted, whether or not the birth mother does.; 1
"If you have ever felt a baby kick in your tummy or the breath of a new born in your ear you will understand why abortion is wrong. Within that little body is a heart, just like yours, a brain with the ability to learn, just as you do, babies are simply little people. Are you allowed to kill a person who you don't really want in your life? Nope. Can you simply get rid of a person because they beside you when you would rather be along? Nope. Why is abortion any different.; 1
"Abortion, although horrible, is sometimes necessary. Being a man, I will never have to be in the position of having an abortion myself so my opinion is somewhat biased in that respect. Since I lack the personal insight about abortion that is so integrally tied to being a woman, I cannot rightfully say that abortion is wrong. Even ignoring this fact, I know that there are extenuating circumstances that can make having an abortion a better choice than not having an abortion. Sometimes one has to choose between the lesser of two evils and sometimes abortion is less wrong.; 1
"While I don't believe that abortion should ever be taken lightly, I do think that abortion should be legal. It should be available to all adults and those minors who have been victims of a rape or incest. There are too many situations where women get pregnant due to force. The government should have no right to force those women to carry a baby full-term and experience the horrible event that caused that pregnancy every day for nine months! I also think that while there are many wonderful people out there who are willing to adopt unwanted babies and give them happy homes, the government regulations make it difficult and often too expensive for many of these families to pursue adoption. So, without abortion, many of the babies in unplanned pregnancies would be left to die in the back alleyways or grow up being past around in the foster care system. What kind of life is that to give a child?; 1
"Abortion should be a personal decision. Women should have the right to their own body. Someone that was raped should have the right to abortion if she wants to. Someone with genetic defects that will be passed on to their children or even HIV+ patients should also be able to abort their child if conceived by accident. A 13 year old girl that got pregnant ignorantly should be able to abort so it does not ruin the rest of her live. Yes, people should take responsibility of their own actions but this should not be done such that you are dragging down another soul with you. The baby is innocent, you do not want another abandoned child that lives in the orphanage or have serious illness to suffer the rest of their lives just because mothers could not end their lives before it is too late, before they have to suffer. The world is over-populated/infested with people, we should be limiting our growth rate. If you want to have unhealthy children, unwanted children or children that weren't brought up correctly, then choose to prevent abortion. So that there will be more people with genetic defects, illness or mental instability in our future generations. We should not be against abortion, because we should believe everyone have a choice. In place of preventing abortion completely, we should have counselors that can help the women make better decisions regarding this action. Better informed women will make better choices for themselves and their babies.; 1
"Abortion is considered as a sin, but there can be circumstances where one is forced to take such a decision as there may be no other options available. I do not consider abortion as a sin. Logically speaking, human beings have a reproductive cycle in which if you concieve, you need not go ahead and have a child always. Its just the matter of sperm meeting the egg, that's all. Now, if you want the child you keep it, else there's always a way out - called Abortion. You are commiting no sin by aborting the feotus. Its always better not to have a child, rather than give birth to it and then make the baby feel unwanted.; 1
"I believe a woman should have a right to get an abortion. She should even not pay for it as well for contraceptive and condoms.. Then she should get a day or two off from work (paid) in order to rest. A woman has a right to decide when is a proper time to give birth to a child.; 1
"I am supportive of abortion in certain scenerios. If you are informed that you will have a baby with severe deformities or medical issues and are not prepared to deal or except them, I belive it okay to abort. I believe in the scientific point that supports the stage in which the fetus becomes a human being. I do not believe that abortion is murder. I believe it is a choice when adoption is far more painful to bare for some mothers.; 1
"I believe that abortion should remain legal. If abortion was to be outlawed many women and girls would lose their lives. There would be cases of self-induced abortions. There is a history of that happening. I believe that there are times when abortions are the only answer. For instance, cases of incest, rape, and severe handicaps in the child.; 1
"Abortion is a necessary evil. In a world where there is rape by family members and other sexual violent acts abortion beomes necessary. In cases where continuing with a pregnancy will kill both mother and baby, abortions are necessary. In order to keep personal freedom for all and imposing our religious views on others abortion should be allowed.; 1
"From the moment you concieve a child it is a life. To abort a child is murder, pure and simple. It is my opinion that without seeing the baby, or feeling the baby move and kick it makes it easier to go through with an abortion. Out of all the woman who have had abortions, I wonder what percentage could kill a baby after it had been born. There are always other options. I wish the aborted fetus could say that.; 1
"Abortion should be regulated by the law. Those that use it as a way to correct what they believe to be a mistake should not beable to just end a life because it isn't convenient for them. Some say that no woman should be forced to have a baby, but I believe that they were not forced to have sex.some will say that if a rape caused the pregancy then an abortion should be an option also. How can we say it is okay to punish the inocent child for what a rapist does? Who is reallAboty paying for the crime? Instead lets get all the help we can for the pregant mother during those nine months and afterwards weather she chooses to keep the baby or not. Of course I do feel that there are times that abortion is the only option when it is done to save the mother's life.; 1
"It is my belief that abortion should be no ones business other than that of the mother whom is carrying the child. It is a personal matter that should be treated as such, and thus, no one should be able to tell a mother what she can and cannot do with her body. Legislation on abortion is completely absurd, as it undermines the very principles of our nation, which are Personal Liberty, and a government that doesn't intrude in to our lives on matters such as abortion.; 1
"When I formed my opinion on abortion, I thought of three things. First, I do not believe that life begins at conception. I don't think we yet know enough about the formation process of a fetus to be able to pinpoint exactly when they are able to feel, but I know enough biology to know it's not early on in the pregnancy. Second, I believe that a woman should have the final say in what happens to her body. Pregnancy takes a huge toll on a woman, and she should be prepared for that, not forced into it. Thirdly, I think about what kind of life this unborn child would have, coming in the world to parents who are not financially or emotionally ready to be parents. For all these reasons, I completely support a woman's right to choose.; 1
"Abortion should be the legal choice of the mother at all times before the fetus can survive without mechanical assistance. I recognize a complex set of legal and ethical issues are involved, but the legal standards would be more inconsistent without this choice. Although in some instances, the murder of a pregnant mother counts as two murders, but in all other legal situations a pregnant mother can not make use of facilities such as carpool lanes reserved for two or more passengers. The unborn child has no legal identity, no documentation in government records. The unborn child dramatically affects the health and welfare of the mother, in many cases the mother of an unwanted child has many healthcare parallels with a cancer patient. Just as a mother has a choice to seek appropriate medical treatment for other conditions affecting her health, she should have control of her own body when the fetus is having undesired affect on her health.; 1
"I believe that the choice to have an abortion is a highly personal one. Abortions are an unfortunate fact of life. They have been taking place in one form or another for centuries. It's a known fact that abortions done under unsanitary conditions will create a risk to the life of the mother. Therefore, I believe that abortions should be legal for reasons of public health.; 1
"I do not believe that a supreme being exists, there is no such thing as a sole. As such a woman is under no obligation to carry a bunch of cells to term. pregnancy is a major health risk and if a woman does not wish to take that risk it is her decision. Further I find the idea that the government has some right to intrude in anyone's personal medical decisions repugnant. We have separation of church and state for a reason and do not need to codify religion in our laws.; 1
"Regardless of specific religious beliefs, the vast majority of humanity knows or feels instinctively that it's wrong to kill another person. I'm 100% positive that no one among us knows exactly when human life actually begins. Since it can be from the only starting point we know of, conception, how can you say whether you're killing a human being or not if you perform or have an abortion? The answer is of course that you don't know. Therefore, no one has the right to decide arbitrarily that a fetus at any given stage is not human, and can be killed without the risk of snuffing out the life of an actual person.; 1
"I am a man, so abortion does not directly affect my body. However, I support womens' right to choose whether or not they carry the babies growing inside their bodies to term. I believe that every citizen has the right to the private control of his body, whether through drugs, sport, meditation, medicine, etc. This right would extend to birth control and abortion issues. If I were to get a woman pregnant, I would hope we could both make an informed decision about the options science has made available to us.; 1
"I would be pro abotion.Think about all the women who have been raped,molested, or date raped.It would already be tragmatic for a women who was in a bad situation like that and it would be even worse for her to carry to term knowing that her child is from a man she not only was not in love with, but also forced himself upon her. Also with techinogly you can find out if your child has even life threating genetic defects.You baby could be born with something such as cycstic frobrois and would have to go through painfully sugeries and testing.Also the rate of cycstic frobrois and death is VERY HIGH and it would be devesating for a mother to care for and raise her child only to lose him/her only a short period of time later.; 1
"A hungry child, drug addicted parent, not wanted, welfare, abused, abandoned. Without the choice this is the life of a child born and NOT cared for. Abortion is NOT wrong it is a choice of the woman.; 1
"I believe in a woman's right to chose, the goverment has no right to control our reproductive abilities. Victims of violence or those with dangerous health conditions should have the ability to decide for themselves whether to follow through with a pregnancy. The ability to terminate a pregancy is not modern invention, thousands of years ago plants and herbs were used for a variety of reasons if a women did not want or was not able to care for the child. And once we open the door to letting somebody else control our reproductive abilities where do you draw the line? Is outlawing birthcontrol and condoms next?; 1
"Abortion is the killing of an innocent life. Life begins at conception. When a woman has an abortion she is having her unborn baby killed. Abortion should be outlawed. Prevention and adoption should be promoted. When you see a beating heart of a baby on an ultrasound there is no dening that the baby is alive.; 1
"Abortion is wrong and should never be resorted to, unless in very extreme cases where the life of the mother and/or the fetus is in danger. Even then it should be used sparingly. Abortion is not birth control. Birth control is something you do BEFORE a baby is conceived. Abortion is killing a baby that you have already conceived. And life begins at conception - a baby just a few weeks old has a beating heart. Some people would argue that abortion is a woman's choice, but what about the child's choice? The baby is being killed for her convenience. It is totally wrong. When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the only humane option is adoption. Abortion is deliberately taking steps to end a life, to stop a beating heart. That is murder.; 1
"I think abortion should be legal. Those who want to abort their kids should have the option to do that. Those who do not want to do that have the freedom to do that also. The choice should be that of the mother and father of the kid.; 1
"I don't believe in abortion. The adult has the say if she is to have sex without protection and the unborn embryo has no say. The only time an abortion should be allowed is in the instance of rape. The person doesn't have the say there and sometimes the child will be the reminder of the rape and be punished for that crime.; 1
""I believe there are times when abortions should be performed. In the case of rape, incest (and the male family member should be prosectued) or when the mother is not in any position to raise the child, this includes teenagers. I would not expect someone to carry a child to term and give it up for adoption, women are not incubators and this could be emotionally damaging to the woman. My beliefs do not fit the ""Pro Choice Agenda"" since I do not agree with abortion on demand and I shun females who do not practice birth control, figuring they can just get an abortion instead."; 1
"Abortion is a sign of inhumanity. I'm only think it's alright if the girl is really young, like 13-14 young. It's a crime. And like any crimes, it should be punished severly.; 1
""I believe abortion is a matter of free choice for women. If a woman finds herself in an unwanted pregnancy she should have the right to terminate that pregnancy in safe medical environment. We should not force women back into dirty clinics and the days of coat hanger hacks performing rotor rooter procedures on women. A woman should have the right to choose whether or not she is in a station in life to give birth to a child and then either raise that child herself or give it up for adoption. Adoption is admirable and certainly does allow loving parents to have babies that they may not be otherwise able to have; and provides able and willing women the opportunity to give birth to their baby and see it placed in a loving environment. The nine months of pregnancy and act of child birth is not insignificant and a woman in an unwanted pregnancy should not be forced to follow through it. "; 1
""Abortion is flatly wrong. I understand that it's a difficult thing for a woman to carry a baby for 9 months, but we all have to make difficult sacrifices sometimes. And simply put, an unborn baby is a human life, and human life needs to be protected. It's not ok for a woman to kill her baby just because it inconveniences her; would we stay it's ok for a woman to kill a two year old just because it inconveniences her?"; 1
"I feel that women should be able to have the choice of whether or not they want to have the baby. If they don't want to, then they should be able to stop it because they are the person who has to have the baby and to take care of it. If they want to have it and feel they are ready then they should. Choice is what makes this country so great and women should have it regarding abortion.; 1
"I believe abortion should be an individual decision and we should respect and tolerate our differences. It should not be placed on a level of religion, which creates some of the the most common and insane reasons to start wars. Not in God's name, but man's name. How can it be fair to dictate to a woman, who is the victim of rape or incest, to carry to term, that which will cause mental anguish for the rest of her life? The child thus becomes a victim as well. Let alone, when is it ever our right, to force someone to live in only our viewpoint? If that is the destiny of mankind, then why not invite the reincarnation of Hitler!; 1
"I have absolutely no problem with abortion. I believe that the world will become a better place if all unwanted children are not born. I am not a religious person, so that in no way clouds my judgment on the subject. Whether or not a woman decides that she is ready and prepared to have a child is her business.; 1
""The decision of whether or not to have an abortion is something that should lie solely with the woman who is pregnant. The fact that the government wants to impede her right to make that decision is preposterous. I believe that the main reason people in the government are against it is that they are men. The second reason people think it's wrong is because the church tells them so, even though people should form their own opinions, not just listen to what their church tells them is wrong or right. That people are allowed to carry guns makes them capable of ending another's life at any time; that's legal--why shouldn't abortion be? For the record, it should be noted that many of these ""pro-life"" individuals also own guns."; 1
"I am completely against abortion. In my opinion, murder is murder. When a person aborts a baby, that person is taking a life. I do not agree with a baby never getting to experience life due to irresponsible parents. I believe that abortion should be illegal in every state.; 1
"Women should have the choice to decide whether or not they can perform abortion. God gave us the free will to make our own decisions. I personally was a child of choice and when given the all the information, an appropriate decision was made. Women should not feel restricted as to the options they have, but they should not be underinformed either. Those that have been raped or medically need abortions should be given the choice especially. Those raped were forced to do something that they did not want to do and by forcing them to choose life is another atrocity in itself. They are forced to relive for 9 to 10 months the crime that was committed. For those that medically need the procedure, by having no choice but to choose life, they are condemned to death. Who decides which life is more important? Should this decision be made by other people whose life is not on the line?; 1
"My opinion in all honestly on abortion is that it is wrong. Abortion is such a terrible way to go out. Even though the young child does not have a name, attributes it is still so wrong to take that life away. People go to jail for years for murder, shouldn't the parents, doctor go to jail they are causing the same exact crime. Abortion should be banned and not allowed in any country on this planet. People who mess up and dont want kids but have them have to deal with the fact that they did this to themselves.; 1
"I believe abortion should only be limited to rape and insest victims. There is no need for it to be avalible to the general public. It is murder. If you are careless enough to get pregnant, you should take responsibility and have the baby. People should have the child and only then can they give it up for adoption if they choose. It is not the child's fault and they should have the right to life.; 1
""Although from a Christian perspective the sanctity of unborn life is a given, that fact alone is not enough to convince the general population of the evil of abortion. But let it be known it is an evil! How many millions of lives are thrown away every year, usually for the ""convenience"" of the mother/family. Even in more legitimate cases, how sad that society will not step in to care for the new life-to-be. It is this aspect that should be made known to America: The choice of life and its preservation is more important than any consideration, especially ones that often boil down to personal selfishness."; 1
"I feel that abortion is wrong. If killing a pregnant mother is double homicide, than it is a double standard that aborting a baby is not murder. Life starts at conception, not after 3 months. At any time in the pregnancy, whether it's partial-birth abortion or not, it is murder to abort the baby. If it is a choice, then the girl should have made the choice not to have sex in the first place. Actions have consequences.; 1
"I think abortion is such a difficult topic because it is something far too personal to be decided by a group or government. I used to believe it was simply wrong, and I still don't think I could have one except in very dire circumstances, but I don't want to be made to have a baby that I cannot face carrying due to some difficult personal life circumstances either.; 1
"Abortion is an ugly topic, but it's not something that can be ignored. A child coming from an unwanted pregnancy will be much more likely to turn to crime, since their mother will not be prepared or willing to take proper care of them. If someone is already in financial difficulty, having a child will only worsen this state, and the child might even be abandoned. I think in some cases abortions are probably the best option, for both the sake of the mother, and the child itself, since the child's quality of life may have been terrible if it were to live. Other points to consider are whether the child was concieved by rape, whether or not the mother has substance abuse problems, and whether or not the child was the product of incest. Late stage abortions on the other hand, are almost too sickening to think about.; 1
"Abortion should be legal. The unborn fetus should only be allowed to be born if that is the choice of the mother. There should not be any religious interpretation about this at all. This should solely be the choice between a women and her doctor.; 1
"Every woman should have the right to choose. Abortion should be a personal choice made by a woman with her doctor's input. The government should not have control over a woman's reproductive organs. A fetus is not a distinct person with human rights until it is able to survive outside the mother's womb. Until the fetus becomes mature enough that it could survive outside the womb (even in a neonatal unit)the woman's health and well-being should always be put first. This tiny, dependent creature, less complex than a grasshopper is a potential human but not yet a person.; 1
"I believe that women have the right to choose where abortion is concerned. It is the woman's own body and she has the right to decide whether or not she wants to terminate the pregnancy. Any other opinion grossly infringes upon a woman's social, moral and legal rights and is not just in every sense of the word.; 1
"Abortion is never an easy choice for a woman, but the government has no right to make that choice for her. I believe that the outlines laid down in Roe V Wade were sensible. They demonstrated applicable concern for the right to privacy. A woman's body is ultimately hers and hers alone, and the government should not impose restrictions upon it. While I understand the religious and moral objections to the action, I believe that these should not be used as a basis to impede on the freedom of another.; 1
"Every woman has her right to choose what to do with her body. Someone should not be forced to have a baby if they are not ready or financially able to provide for that child. No one should be able to choose for someone else, especially on such a big decision as this. If abortion is illegal, people will find more harmful ways to get to the same conculsion.; 1
"I think that abortion is not really a good way to go when you have a child. I understand that in some cases it is not a good idea to have the child but that is why they have adoption services to find them a good home. Of course they are those times when a woman was violated and I understand the pain she feels and that they would not want to have that child but the child didn't ask to be made. I feel they should still have the child and just give it up for adoption so that it has a chance to have a good life.; 1
"I believe that abortion is a very personal matter only to be determined by the person(s) involved. I personally would probably never have an abortion, but I do believe there are circumstances to which it would be an option. I believe that if the child has such horrible birth defects that they can never live a good life that abortion could be an option. Also in the event of rape or incest I believe it could be a possibility. All in all my belief is that abortion is a very personal matter.; 1
""Abortion is wrong because a person is given a soul at the moment of conception. God said that He knew you before you were formed. A baby has a heartbeat and brain wave activity weeks before the woman even realizes she may be pregnant. If it weren't for Planned Parenthood's concerted effort to force abortion as a right and even change the way we think, we would all still realize that abortion is murder. Calling the baby a zygote or a fetus dehumanizes the baby. ""I think, therefore I am."; 1
"My position on abortion is pro-choice. I think the Supreme Court got it right on the Roe vs. Wade case when they said the decision to have an abortion is a personal, private decision that should not be infringed on by the government. This is especially acute in situations of rape and incest where the woman or child's rights have already been violated. No one should be forced to go through a pregnancy and every child who comes into the world should be welcomed and loved freely.; 1
""I believe abortion is morally wrong. It is a sin for a mother to kill her unborn child. Human life begins at conception, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. I believe what the Bible infers in Psalms chapter 139 verses 13-16: ""For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully \u0026 wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."" Abortion is murder. I believe the unborn child is created by God and He has a purpose for him/her. God is not necessarily pleased by certain unfortunate circumstances of pregnancy, but when conception occurs, He knows about it and loves the child and has a particular plan for that child's life in this world."; 1
"I believe the choice of abortion should remain with the parents of the unborn child. Mother should have more rights to decide what to do. If abortion is needed because the foetus has some deformity, then there is nothing wrong with it. Apart from that I feel it is the choice of a person whether to go for abortion or not. Our culture and society terms abortion as cruel, so I personally would prefer to keep away from it, except for life threatening situation. I would definitely be guilt ridden.; 1
""I believe abortion is equivalent to murder. However, I think it should be an available option to only a few certain cases. Abortion should be limited to women with health issues, or women who are victims of rape. It should not be available to those who are careless and can ""erase"" their own mistake. Making abortion available to everyone allows reckless women to have unprotected sex without the worry of getting pregnant, because they can just ""fix"" it afterwards."; 1
""I am a pro-choice person; however, I am pro-life for myself. I do not believe that the government should be able to tell any woman what to do with her body or pregnancy. I do believe that life begins at conception. I would only have an abortion if I were raped or the baby or myself was in danger. I do not believe that abortion should be used instead of birth control. I feel that sex education is key in limiting the number of abortions needed/wanted in our country."; 1
"I think that abortion is morally wrong. However, I also think that it isn't the governments place to dictate what people do with their bodies. Even if abortion were to be outlawed, they would still occur. Probably with more risks attached, too. Think about the war on drugs. If drugs were legal, gang revenues would be cut, violence would go down, drug purity (and therefor safety) would go up. But since they are illegal, gangs sell them on the street to make money which they use to kill people, and the drugs are cut with god knows what. Abortion would be no different. We would have women pulling fetuses out of their uterus with coat hangers and all other kinds of nasty things. Doesn't make sense to have a law that can't be enforced.; 1
"When does life begin? Proponents of abortion would say that science can't determine that answer. If it can't be determined, then it must begin at conception. It is illogical to say that at 2 months, 30 days there isn't a life growing inside a woman (when a woman can get an abortion), but at 3 months there is a life (when a woman can't get an abortion). Just because a pregnancy might not be convenient for a woman doesn't mean there isn't a life growing within her.; 1
"I believe that abortion is wrong, but only because I believe life begins at conception. This debate comes down to that point, no matter the range of arguments for or against abortion. Where does life begin? This is the question that must be answered. The baby that will emerge has its own DNA, its own blood type, and many more features that distinguish him or her from simply being a part of the mother's body. Because I believe abortion is wrong, that does not mean I am unwilling to sacrifice that baby's life to save the mother. Therefore, I do not believe it should be illegal to kill the baby in that case.; 1
"I believe that abortion is a tragic choice, but it is just that: a choice. I have reached a philosophical viewpoint in which I do not think I could choose to have an abortion, but I still believe that it should be the woman's decision as to whether she brings an unplanned pregnancy to term. We should focus on reducing abortion by making birth control more accessible and affordable, and providing thorough education. We should also make sure that women know all their options so they can make a truly informed decision. I fully believe that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.; 1
"It's not for the government to decide what a woman chooses for herself. Just as it's not for government to decide what any citizen chooses for him or herself. Abortion is no different as a choice than any other topic, it's simply more inflammatory. There is nothing here to legislate. It is one person being given the opportunity to decide what is right for themselves.; 1
"I believe in pro- choice. There are certain times when an abortion is necessary. Not only in the cases of rape or incest, but when the future of a young girl is on the line. No sixteen year old should see her and her child's life trashed because of poverty and lack of options in the world.; 1
"I believe that everyone should have the right to choose. While I can not think of any circumstances under which I would personally opt to have an abortion, I do not think that it is my right to make that decision for another person. Just because I believe that aborting a baby is not something I could ever live with spiritually or emotionally, does not mean I think that I can deign to judge someone elses decision to have one. I do not believe that abortion should be used as a form of birth control and I feel that people who do have frequent abortions should have to talk with a counselor of some sort before any subsequent abortions.; 1
"Abortion should be legal. In horrific cases such as rape, incest, an inherited disease or genetic condition, or when a woman's life is in danger due to the pregnancy, the option to abort should be given. As long as women get pregnant, there will be women having abortions. The only difference is a that a woman can go to a real doctor who can perform the operation safely and humanely or go to a quack. If social programs such as welfare, medicaid, social service agencies, headstart and other programs are not adequately funded (as in many states they are not) it is almost as bad allowing a child grow up without a safety net, without a family, without ever knowing what it is like to be loved and cared for than it is to have an abortion.; 1
"Abortion should be a choice given to any woman who is pregnant. The burden is hers to keep or disown. When a fetus is still small, it won't miss out on anything good in life, so it is not murder. When an unwanted child is put into the world, their life is bad, and it could have been prevented by having abortion. Besides, preventing abortion may risk dangerous abortions that are done outside of hospitals.; 1
"I am against abortion. I think it's demoralizing, and I also think girls use it as an easy out of pregnancy. They dont realize theyre taking a human life, and dont want to face the consequences. I think abortion should only be legalized in the event that the mother is in grave danger or the baby is.; 1
"I am pro-abortion because I support the fact that a woman, and only a woman, has the right to decide what she does with her body. A woman's reproductive system should not be controlled over by the government. It is an individual woman's choice whether or not she wants to have a child. There are so many factors that can make a woman not want to have a child that I believe the government has no right to take control over.; 1
"In life, there are things that eat out our life like cancer hollows our body: abortion on demand is one of these cancers. It allows us to devalue another human life and turns a human being's Constitutional rights a matter of another's opinion. It weakens our moral fiber, as it weakens our willingness to stand for what it right not what is easy, what benefits others instead of what benefits us, what is is best for another instead of just for us, what is good for the long term rather than easier at the present. It weakens our country as 50 million people who would be voting, paying Social Security, creating and buying products are all gone -- the toll of abortion since Roe vs. Wade. Worst of all, it weakens me, since I an willing to surrender another's life for my comfort. If you believe that I am willing to force my will on another without having experienced their pain, you're wrong. I and my wife made made this choice once, and I can tell you that it was the wrong choice. It was the convenient choice, even an economically and socially acceptable choice at the time. It was still the wrong one.; 1
"I believe that abortion is murder. Discarding a human life in this manner is wrong socially and spiritually. Personally, I could not live with myself if I destroyed a life out of selfishness. I think there are rare cases when the mothers life is in jeopardy and it could be considered. I am not saying that I agree with it in this situation but this is the only reason that I can justify abortion.; 1
"To me, abortion is a solution to a problem. The fact that the problem seems to mostly arise from not being careful in our behaviors troubles me. If we were more careful in preventing pregnancy in the first place, abortion procedures could be limited to medical necessity or in rape cases. And then ultimately, the solution of abortion becomes a problem from the possible physical and emotional trauma that occurs after the procedure. So I believe in pro-choice but believe that it is an imperfect solution that has risks and consequences.; 1
"I believe that abortion is not an option. I believe that from conception, a life was created. Why or how could anyone have an abortion and take matters in their own hands. How could they decide that the 'life' they conceived doesn't deserve to 'live'. That is the choice of a much higher power. It should not be ours. If you don't want to keep the baby, there are always alternative means..adoption for a childless couple for one.; 1
"Abortion rights are natural law, and have no place being decided on a political level. A woman's body is hers to govern, not yours. If a woman has decided that at this time in her life she is not prepared to be the best mother she can be to a child, then far be it from me to judge her decision. If a woman is beaten, raped, and left for dead in a field, why should she be forced to keep a baby that is not a creation of a loving union between two partners? Being pregnant should not be the be all end all of sex. If I choose to engage in sex with a man, that is my choice. If that sex results in a pregnancy, it is my body and my mind that should be making the decision, not someone elses religion, not someone elses opinion. Should someone else be allowed to decide if I can eat, breathe, speak, or even have sex? That would be preposterous. So, then, why do some people think they can tell me what I can and can't do with my own body in regards to abortion? It is completely absurd.; 1
"Abortion in the United States is not clinical and safe. It is presumed that since abortions are performed as a medical procedure that all doctors are licensed, and the doctors that are ethical and competent. It is taken for granted that any medical procedures that take place in the United States are guaranteed safe from malpractice and ill-educated people. Abortion is a hot topic that brings out the religious fanatics that have bomb clinics in attempts to intimidate and close abortion clinics. Most doctors shy away from such controversy and threats and therefore, shrinks the number of doctors that are competent and increasing the risk of incompetent doctors.; 1
"In my opinion, abortion is wrong. I've been presented with a situation in my own life where not having an abortion put myself at personal risk. But when looking at my other children, I could not bear to think that I had terminated the life of one of my children to save myself. I believe that life begins at conception and that all persons have the right no life. As human beings, this is our most precious gift. To terminate a life is to throw away a gift from God and the future of man.; 1
"I am against abortion. I feel that to get an abortion done is a crime equivalent to murder. You are killing an unborn child and taking away his chance of coming into this world. The innocent soul to whom God has given the chance to come in human form is being deprived of this golden opportunity. Spirituality says that it is only in human form that one can realize oneself to be a soul and know God. By aborting a child one is also doing a sin for which one has to pay in future according to the law of karma.; 1
"Every woman should have a choice, especially over her own body. I agree that voluntary abortion should be made legal everywhere. It should also be affordable and accessible to all women. Women should be able to go to place where she is comfortable and can have an abortion safely and without any judgment or fear. To tell a woman what she can do with her own body is a crime. While I respect all life, I also respect a woman's choice.; 1
""I believe abortion is pro-choice. My reasons for this belief are simple. There are situations where a woman is either raped or has a loveless marriage in which she cannot afford to bring a child into this world and the father will not support her and has left her or has chose to help her ""fix"" the situation. It takes two to tango, so if the father walks why not the mother. Why should the mother be left ""holding the baby""? Nine times out of ten the child will have a hard life and because his/her mother is single, the child will become a detriment to society. Not to mention the social issues this child will have because he/she are growing up with one parent. No, pro-choice is the way to go and is best for the parents and society.; 1
"Regardless of your opinion on abortion, you must realize that the choice is not yours. This country is known for freedom, including freedom of choice. Forcing someone else to conform to your morality when it does not affect you in any way is wrong. If you don't support abortion, then don't have one.; 1
""I believe that abortion is a personal choice. As it is such a personal choice, the government does not have the right to mandate abortion. No woman deserves to have her choice denigrated, nor do they deserve to be shouted at and called ""baby killers"" while entering the clinic. I freely admit that abortion is not an ideal solution, but the fact remains that it is a legal and personal solution to a difficult situation. Lest we go back to the days of coat hangers and back-alley procedures, abortion needs to remain safe and legal.; 1
"I don't know what to think about abortion. What does it mean to have a soul, if indeed people have souls, when you're just a fetus? Does the soul care at that point whether it lives or dies, and does the abortion have any adverse effect upon the soul? There are too many unanswered questions about who we are as human beings for me to form a reasonable opinion on the matter. I don't think I could personally abort anything. It seems a little heartless to me.; 1
"The option of abortion is and always should be legal and at the sole discretion of the female in which the embryo/fetus resides, regardless of her age... geographical location... the situation leading to the unwanted pregnancy or her prior history of/with abortion. At no time during pregnancy does an embryo/fetus possess the same faculties or level of coherent consciousness of a newborn baby. There is no baby in pregnancy, only in birth and thus a fetus is never a sentient being with rights. Males need to accept the fact that their rights to any say as to what happens to their genetic material starts when they decide to have intercourse, stops when they ejaculate and could possibly resume after the female decides to make her body available to the fetus for the entirety of the gestational period. Said rights are not equal but neither are the part each sex has to play in the formation of what may become a baby.; 1
"The abortion it's the best solution for the women. It's very clear that the sexual and reproductive rights of the women must be protected. The history and the laws recognize the right to choose freely if she wants to become a mother. Because that, the right of a woman that wants to interrupt her pregnancy must be defended at any costs. Believe me, it's better an abortion that a homeless or abused child.; 1
"Abortion is a really tricky subject. I deeply believe that women have the right to make their own choices about their bodies. No one should make that choice for them, not their parents, spouses or government. A woman's right to abortion should be protected. However, there is just something horribly sad about that loss of potential life. I wish women never had to put in that position in the first place. Perhaps better sex education would change our conversation about the need for abortion.; 1
""Let's face it. There is no God, at least not a fatherly lovely one. Which father will let his sons suffer horribly as we do everyday ? So let's forget about religion or absolute values in our discussion. The only thing that I rate is pain. I do not like pain (either physical or mental) and I believe everybody should at least try to reduce the pain he inflict on other human beings, try to not augment the amount of sorrow on the earth. Since I do not attribute an ""absolute"" value to life, I believe that a life of pain has no reason and I believe that there are already too many useless human beings and too many unloved human beings. So it is a crime to bring to life a human being with with high probability will be unloved, crippled or homeless. It is better to kill it before he is conscious. And yes, I know it is sort of a murder, but I prefer it done early than later.; 1
"Abortion should be illegal. Conception is when a molecule becomes a human being. Terminating a pregnancy is the same as killing. God will punish anyone who commits murder. It doesn't matter how that pregnancy came to be, the child has a right to live, and the government should punish the woman the same as they would any killer.; 0
"An unborn child is still a living being, who should be given the rights any other human has. This includes the right to life. No person, including the mother of an unborn child has the right to kill a living human being. If a woman finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, she has the option to put the baby up for adoption. There are many loving couples who would love the opportunity to adopt a baby.; 0
"Medical procedures save lives. Abortion is consonant with the termination of lives. Changing the language to describe abortion doesn't avoid this. People should not be allowed to choose to end the lives of others, whether that is abortion, capital punishment, murder, decisions to go to war etc. Let's help to provide adequate sex education, contraception, social services, support, safe streets to walk on, protection from male violence etc., before the perceived need for abortion occurs.; 0
"Abortion should be legal and is a good thing in all cases. It is the parents right to do whatever they want. There should be no time limit on abortions whatsoever. People should be rewarded financially for abortions for their service in keeping world population down.; 0
"Its not good...I am not completely against it. It depends on the situation the girl or woman may be in. I do believe if its going to be done, it needs to be done early on..; 0
"It is the woman's choice whether she keeps or aborts her unborn baby. It is her body and therefore should be her choice. The fetus is not really a human being at that early stage. The fetus becomes a human being only after about 5 or 6 months of age. So having an abortion is not the same as killing a baby or a human being. If a woman does not feel she can raise a baby, it is better for her to abort than bring an unwanted child into the world.; 0
"A woman has free will and free choice over what goes on in her body. If the child has not been born, it is under her control. Often the circumstances an unwanted child is born into are worse than death. The mother has the responsibility to choose the best course for her child and herself.; 0
""I believe abortion is wrong. I do not think that innocent babies should have to suffer for mistakes an adult makes. If someone finds themselves in a position where they are unable or unwilling to care for a baby, they should give the child up for adoption. There are many families willing and wanting children and adoption can help not only the birth mothers of these ""unwanted"" children, but it can also help a couple wanting a child that is unable to conceive. "; 0
""Abortion is a great option because children shouldn't be born into households that can't raise a child well. It is a great way to keep the surplus population down, allowing for a cleaner less crowded world. I think that a zygote or fetus isn't a person in the mother's womb until the fetus has developed recognizable human features; otherwise it is an unfeeling, unthinking, soulless growth inside the woman and is fine to abort without feelings of remorse and guilt. Abortion is a great option for young women who find themselves in a situation they are not prepared to handle, and could potentially ruin their lives. "; 0
"I think abortion should absolutely be illegal. From the minute that sperm hits the egg, life is created. It would unfair to take away the life of an innocent child that has done nothing to the mother. Families can always put babies up for adoption, and even choose the adoptive families if they would like. For teen mothers, there are homes where they can go for their duration of their pregnancy so they do not have to face ridicule. Taking away a life on purpose is considered a criminal offense in every state and life in jail without parole is usually the sentence. Nothing is different from taking away the life of an innocent child, women should be punished for killing a life they helped create. Overrall, abortion wrong and immoral and shoule be illegal.; 0
"God states that you cannot have abortions, as you are killing your children. You will go to hell, and that is as simple as it gets. Removing a life from the womb is the same as murdering a living human. It is wrong.; 0
"I Think everyone needs to think about the other person here THE BABY !! Women know all the side effects of sex .I know the power of love and attraction is strong but what should always be on the back of her mind is that a dead child is not worth it. I think that a year of heartache (pregnancy and birth and time to heal ) is worth a babies life. Adoption is a gift to the world and the child .I think there needs to be more organasations to help young and older women go through this process .; 0
"There are somethings too ghastly to even debate. Probably the most simplistic of these subjects is whether or not it is ok to kill another human being. This may be the worst thing anyone can do, rob someone of their god given right to life. Who are we to decide who lives or dies especially when we made the choice to concieve a life. This is why abortion is wrong. It would never have been necessary without the initial conception. If you do the crime you do the time.; 0
"Abortion is a good idea in many circumstances. Modern genetic testing can determine whether the embryo is likely to suffer from any birth defects or genetic disorders - if so, terminate the pregnancy and try again. Raising a child is expensive, and for poor women the cost will largely be borne by the taxpayers in the form of government programs such as WIC, SCHIP, and food assistance programs. Subsidized on-demand abortions would be vastly less expensive, and permit the former mother to return to the work force and improve her lot. Finally, while the United States does not experience the crippling food shortages of some developing nations, we are developing an excess population. We consume energy out of proportion to our population and are experiencing increasing unemployment as jobs are sent to other countries. We do not need more people, and terminating unwanted pregnancies would go some way toward reducing our ecological footprint, while allowing the rest of us to live a better life.; 0
"I believe that abortion is horrible. Abortion is getting rid of a part of you. It is like murdering a human being. There are ways to take care of a child if you have to. If you Weren't ready for it you shouldn't have done the act that conceived it.; 0
"Abortion is a very acceptable way to end an unwanted pregnancy. Every woman has the right to make the choice of what to do with her body and if being pregnant and giving birth isn't what she wants then having an abortion is strictly her decision and right. A baby isn't really a human being until it is born and therefore abortion is not murder. The fact of the matter is that there are alreay too many children in this world and not enough parents who truly want them and this contributes to the high crime rate among teenagers.; 0
"I believe that abortion should be outlawed under any circumstances. Never should a fetus be punished by death because of bad decisions made by mothers. If you don't want the baby after it is born, adoption is always an option. Abortion is a brutal way of getting rid of bad mistakes. Fetuses have rights at the moment of conception they become human beings. We do not get rid of our unwanted people by killing them off.; 0
"A child gains full rights at the moment it is not dependent upon the mother for life. Until that moment of birth, the mother's rights to life, healthy, security and control of her body over-ride those of the potential child. Thus she may end the pregnancy at any time until birth (or perhaps legal person-hood). She retains the choice to bear the child and put it for adoption, as well as the right to not bear the child at all.; 0
"I am me. If I own anything else in the world, it is me. I choose what I eat. I choose when I sleep. I am in control of me. If I choose to abort what is in my body, it is up to me. I am me.; 0
"Life begins at conception. There is no way around it--abortion is murder. The taking of an innocent life is wrong no matter the circumstance. If the pregnancy might kill the mother, then it is God's will that she might die. God has a plan for all of us and death is part of that plan. It is not our role to choose when another person may live or die.; 0
"Abortion goes directly against biblical teaching. There are many, many families who wish to provide good, happy homes for children of unplanned pregnancies. Why choose to kill your baby that was created out of your irresponsible actions? Do two wrongs make a right? At least, give your baby the opportunity to grow up in a loving family where hopefully they will learn to have responsible sex practices.; 0
"Everyone has the right to live, including unborn children. Abortion should be viewed as homicide. They have the right to live their lives and fulfill their dreams. Many people would love to adopt children and couldn't, so if you cannot keep your child, you should allow people to adopt your baby and give it a chance to live. People should take responsibility for their actions so if they accidentally have a baby, they need to deal with the consequences. In some countries, the population is growing negatively so every baby should be born and raised.; 0
"Children are God's greatest gift! Then why abort? If you have concieved that means God Himself has planned to gift you another child! Or, its His plan to bring another life on earth! Then who are you to interfere in His doings?! Abortion should be considered illegal worldwide, and people following it should be punished. Abortion many-a-times leads to complications in your body also. God may punish you by making you unable to concieve ever after an abortion. So beware and don't do it ever!; 0
"If a woman does not want to get pregnant she can just stop having sex until she meets the right person. She is responsible all the time she is fertile to use a pill or get a shot of contraceptive. A woman must force a man to use a condom. It is good for her to get pregnant and not play with sex and life. Sex is for making baby not for fun.; 0
"I believe abortion is murder. When a woman becomes pregnant that is a life, not an object to be aborted. I believe that adoption is the choice to be made if the mother decides that she is not ready or cannot support a child. I belive under no circumstances she the answer to an unwanted pregnancy be abortion.; 0
"I believe abortion should be against the law. Having an abortion is the same as taking a human life. There is not one reason to ever have to preform an abortion. Every human being from the time of conception has a right to life.; 0
"Abortion is evil. Abortion kills babies daily. We should not allow others to kill their unborn children no matter what the cost. It is our moral obligation to stop others from committing homicide. If the child were born we would not allow a parent to kill their child.; 0
"I make my position known that I support abortion. With teen pregnancy rates at all time highs, this gives our younger generation an option to continue in childhood thierselves. This will keep our young mothers off of welfare and our taxpayers from footing the bill. I feel it is a womans right to choose when she becomes a parent and not pregnancy choose her.; 0
"Woman have the freedom to vote, the freedom to hold the same jobs that men do, and are equal in everyway. So why do we feel that we can control there body when it comes to having a baby? Abortion should be legal and offered as an accepted choice for every woman. Pregancy is demanding on a woman in many ways. We can treat many serious illnesses to prolong life and make it as best as possible for everyone but then tell woman that if they become pregant and do not want the child that they have to anyway. How is that fair? Is forcing woman to have unwanted children going to make them into great parents? We have become to far in society to turn back now. Let woman have the freedom of choice.; 0
"Abortion is a medical practice that should be outlawed because it is taking away the life of a defenseless baby that would have had a chance to live. This is basically murder, the destruction of life. If we allow something like abortion to remain illegal, hundreds of thousands of potential adults will never have gotten the chance to live. They will miss out on an opportunity to carve their own destiny, simply because the mother choose to abort.; 0
"I do not support a woman's right to choose. A life begins at conception, and abortion is murdering an innocent child. God chooses when a life should begin, and we should accept any life as a gift from God. There is a good alternative to killing an innocent child if a woman is not ready for parenthood. Adoption gives a child to a couple who cannot have one themselves, who are willing to give a loving home to otherwise unwanted children.; 0
"Abortion should be banned at all times. In many states, the murder of a pregnant mother counts as two murders, therefore it follows that the legal standard in those states should be imposed on the mother, who by the premeditated death of her unborn child, has committed the same crime as the double murder, by taking one life which counted as a second murder for the other perpetrator. Further, the unborn child is a sentient being, and expresses many complex emotions and behaviors while developing in the protected environment of the womb.; 0
"I believe that the government should decide for people whether they are allowed to have an abortion or not. This is because the answer is simple: nobody should be allowed to have an abortion. If the government makes it illegal then many thousands of babies will have their lives saved each year. Besides, any woman who is willing to take the risk to have an illegal abortion deserves whatever consequences come as a result. She is a murderer.; 0
"Life begins at conception. Life is sacred and a gift from god. It is a sin against god to interfere with his sacred plan so we cannot allow abortion. It is gods will that you get pregnant who are you to question god? There are plenty of loving families that are unable to have children so adoption is the solution to this problem.; 0
"A woman has the right to choose what to do with her own body. A fetus in the womb is in fact part of her own body, because her body produced it, and it depends entirely on what she supplies in order to even exist. She can do what she likes with it, with no moral implications at all. Even conceding that this is a separate organism, it would be a kind of parasite using her body to survive. Any person has the right to rid themselves of a parasite, no matter how it came about, and even if it happens to be human. It's her body, her decision, and nobody else's business.; 0
"I am a man, so abortion does not directly affect my body. However, I do not support womens' right to choose whether or not they carry the babies growing inside their bodies to term. I believe that every human life is sacred, and has the right to be protected by the state. This right to life would extend to abortion because the fetus is a living being which is not merely part of its mother's body (unlike say, an organ). If I were to get a woman pregnant, I would hope our legal and medical system would encourage us to carry the baby to term and create new life, rather than destroy it.; 0
"I would be against abortion. Think about all the families who desperatly want children and can not concieve.Women can give there babies up for adotion if they can't take care of them or don't want to have them.

"Abortion is a woman's right. The government, state or federal, has no right to regulate what a woman can do with her own uterus. It is a woman's body and therefore the woman's choice what she does with that body. Banning abortion would not stop people from seeking to abort their unwanted pregnancies, it would just cut off their safe and medically sound avenues for getting an abortion. Denying a woman the ability to control her own uterus is completely wrong for the government to do.; 0
"Abortion should not be legal as society may be misuse it to abort girl child as is common in male centric societies like India. Parents who are not of a sound mind may decide wrongly about the fate of their kid. Families may force abortion on girls when the family honor is at issue as is the case in Arab world and south east Asia. Kids with diseases or handicap may be at the receiving end of abortion as well.; 0
"I believe if you want to have sex go ahead and have it unprotected. You can always run to the nearest doctor to have your mistakes taken care of. If you want to have sex without the worry of a child then the abortion control shouldn't say a thing about it after all you are an adult.; 0
"Life begins at conception. Destorying that life in any form, abortion included, is murder. It is God's will that a woman is impregnated, no matter what the circumstances and that child should be carried to term and born. If a woman does not want a child, she should not have sex.; 0
"Every woman has the right to do what she wants. It's her body. Abortions should be legalized in all countries. It's the solution to an unwanted birth.; 0
"Abortions should be outlawed and anyone found having an abortion or performing abortions should be immediately arrested, charged and tried for crimes against humanity. Women should be more responsible with their bodies. Abstinence would be preferable, but if a woman chooses to give herself away then she should at least be responsible enough to use birth control. If a woman is a victim of sexual assault and finds herself pregnant as a result then it is the will of God and she should carry the child to term, give birth, and either raise the child or give it up for adoption. There are plenty of desirous couples out there desperately wanting a baby to love and raise. I would support a constitutional amendment making abortion illegal in the United States.; 0
"Abortion needs to be a right guaranteed to all women. Women can have careers derailed, relationships with parents ruined, and a great deal of shame brought on them by an unwanted pregnancy. And the right to choose to terminate that pregnancy should be guaranteed to the women. A women's body is her own, and no government should tell her what she can or cannot do with her body, and what she can and cannot do with her life.; 0
"Women shouldn't have a choice because it is a life that they are killing. If they were so against having a child in the first place then they should have done better measures in preventing it. Human life is precious even in it's early stages. Women should have to pay for their mistakes if they want to keep making them.; 0
"Abortion should be outlawed. It strikes at our moral fabric and punishes the helpless. Unfortunate as it may be for victims of crime, we must see the good that can come from a tragedy. Adoption is a viable alternative to termination. Although unplanned pregnancies can be troublesome, with proper legislation, we can insure the rights and care of the unborn. Our children and children to be must be protected at all costs, as they are future of humanity.; 0
"Abortion is a dangerous way of performing birth control. The bible states that murder of any kind is a sin. A child's life begins at conception and nobody has the right to take life from anyone, regardless of circumstances around the pregnancy. Every life conceived deserves to be lived.; 0
"Abortion is murder. How can a person make a decision to end the life of another's, when that other individual involved has hardly had the chance to live yet? Abortion should be completely and utterly banned. Even if incest, sexual abuse, or rape is the case, abortion should be illegal, because there are far too many childless American couples who would provide loving homes to these children, were they available for adoption. It is my conviction that once a life has begun to grow inside of you, it is no longer your decision or that of anyone else whether or not that life shall be permitted to exist and grow.; 0
"I believe abortion should be accepted nationwide. A person should be able to choose whether or not they want the responsibility of parenthood. Sometimes babies are conceived on accident. Therefore, it should be perfectly fine for an unprepared woman to abort a baby.; 0
"Abortion should not be allowed as many women today use it as a recreational tool to prevent an unwanted birth on their whims. Life begins at day 3 and by using abortion, it is a death sentence. Those that were raped should be given the information so that they can give the child up for adoption if they so wish. Those that are overwhelmed with a pregnancy due to their young age or due to their marital status should be given counseling and support so that they can be equipped with the information needed to raise a child. Abortion should not be an option so that we can have more responsible decisions when it comes to sex.; 0
"I believe in abortion 100% If you mess up, you always have the option for abortion. Abortion is perfect when teenagers have unprotected sex and become pregnant. It is hard enough to raise an animal on your own if your a teenager, i cannot even imagine the responsibility of raising a child! Abortion is the last option you have if your going to have a baby when you do not want to have a baby.; 0
"Abortion should be legal all the time. Sometimes women have no other choice. It is a valid form of birth control. The baby inside is not old enough to know it is about to be killed, therefor it is not a form of murder. When you are not ready to have a child, you should be able to dispose of it, no questions asked. It is no one's business but your own.; 0
"It is sad that so many religious folk mask their disdain for women in the cloak of God and his ancient scriptures. Denial of a woman's right to abortion is simply one facet of the agenda of male domination: To keep the female in the house, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom. Such men are so threatened by general female participation in society that seek often even to ban the use of contraceptives, so that the sexual act -- free of consequene for the man -- saddles the woman with nine months of labor, and then 18 years of childrearing, effectively shutting her out of society. How sad and pathetic!; 0
"Abortion is a woman's choice, and government has no right to make the decision for her. If a woman is raped, then it is fine for her to have an abortion. She did not want the baby anyways. A baby's life does not start until the point at which they can survive outside of the womb.; 0
"I believe abortion is always wrong. It doesn't matter when it takes place, what the circumstances are. A child is a child, whether there is a heartbeat or not, whether the fertilized egg has even implanted yet. It is still a child.; 0
"Abortions are wrong in so many ways. The instant a child is conceived, they are a human being, and should have the rights of every human being. Terminating a pregnancy is murder, because you are ending a human life. Everyone who takes part in an abortion is a murderer, and should be punished. There are many options for unwanted children that don't involve killing them, including adoption, and foster homes.; 0
""The ""baby"" needs to live under any and all circumstances, even the rape of the mother or incest. It is not the fault of the ""baby"" how it came into existence. God wants this baby to be born so it should be. There will always be a home available for any and all babies"; 0
"Every embryo is a human life from the second of conception. Once a sperm and egg unite they become a person with full human rights to life. To have an abortion is murder and it should be illegal no matter what the circumstances. Abortion is murder of the worst sort - the murder of innocents. Women should not be allowed to kill their babies just because they are an inconvenience. Abortion is murder.; 0
"Women do not have the right to choose where abortion is concerned. It is another life the woman is taking and no one has the right to take another life. Any other opinion grossly infringes upon the rights of the newborn and the rights of humans to exist in general.; 0
"Abortion is tantamount to murder, and thus should be considered a crime. Life begins at the second conception takes place, and to destroy that life is wrong. To let unscrupulous women murder their one-night stand mistakes because of their poor planning is horrendous. These unborn children deserve a right to life.; 0
"If you make the choices to be unprepared in the first place you are making the choice to have a baby if that should happen. Life starts a conception and every life is sacred and important. It is never okay to take a life. More education needs to be made in order to teach people about being cautious and practicing abstinance.; 0
"Abortion is good for most people especially those women who have been victims of a sex crime. How could anyone really want them to carry a child of a rapist in their womb for nine months and then give it away. Who is to say that if that child is a boy he won't turn out with the same views as his father. Most criminals inherit some type of their behavior from their actual parents. There is also the view of freedom of choice if a woman wants to abort her child she does have the ability to do so without anyone getting in her way.; 0
"I do not think you should have an abortion for any reason. It is the consequences of life to deal with whatever you have to and if you get pregnant so be it. If your child has severe birth defects there are ways to take care of that child. There are always other options other than abortion.; 0
"Just like I don't have the right to tell a man what to do with his body, no one has the right to tell me what I can or cannot do as a woman, with my body. If a pregnancy is an inconvenience I shouldn't have to be inconvenienced. This is my body. After all, it's just a mass of cells. It can't think, breath or even take care of itself. The US Gov't says abortion is legal. Leave it at that.; 0
"Life begins at conception. That takes precedence over anything else. There are so many forms of contraception out there that there should be no such thing as an unexpected pregnancy. Women need to take responsibility before sex and have an appropriate contraceptive to avoid unwanted pregnancy; 0
""I believe a woman has the right to control her body and do what she wants. Any woman should be able to terminate an unwanted pregnancy for any reason that occurs. Abortion is not killing or murdering, because it is merely tissue that is growing inside the womb - not a real human being. In fact, a fetus is not truly a human being until it is in the 3rd trimester or even when it is outside the womb. A woman or young girl's goals or desires in her life should not be interrupted or changed just because she is pregnant. An unwanted child should not be allowed to live; in this way the mother is benefitted in the best way possible. The mother's wishes are more important than the baby in the womb. Abortion should be allowed at any stage of pregnancy -- whatever will help the mother most in her situation."; 0
"Abortion should be allowed without any restraining factors. People should be allowed to get of unwanted pregnancies if they wish to. Some regions have high abortion rates, since people want male children, and law should not interfere with this. There should be complete independence about abortion, with the mother being the main person who decides about going for abortion.; 0
"Abortion is not murder, as the fetus is not alive. Abortion should be available to any woman who needs it. Its available for those women who do not want a child. Taking away abortion rights would force parenthood teenagers and women who aren't ready. This would possibly result in neglect of the child.; 0
"I think abortion is fine for anyone for any reason. I would have an abortion if I found out I was pregnant and feel its better than being on drugs all the time to keep yourself from being pregnant. I think that abortion should be used more. More people need to have abortions to prevent overpopulation of the species and to get rid of unwanted babies.; 0
"Abortion is murder! Life starts at the moment of conception. All life is God given, and you are thereby killing a little part of God as well as your child. Any and all life must be allowed to continue from conception to it's natural end.; 0
"Abortion is and should always be legal. If it isn't legal then women would be harming themselves and breaking the law by seeking illegal abortions. Since men don't have to bear the burden they shouldn't have a say in the matter of abortion. Life doesn't begin at conception, but I can't tell you when it does start - that is for a woman to decide. It is her body and she can do what she wishes with it.; 0
"To consider abortion wrong or even murder is to place force a minority's religious beliefs on the majority. It also might place a woman's life in jeopardy. Every woman should have the right to choose what to do with her own body. The fetus, in its inability to survive apart from the woman's body, proves that it is not really alive apart from the mother. Life begins when the baby emerges from the womb, or at least when it could survive on its own, not when it exists in a pre-human state. You can only murder a human.; 0
"I believe that abortion is murder and should not be allowed under any circumstances. It is against God's law. Abortion ends the life of an unborn child, an innocent baby who should not be punished by the poor choices or circumstances of the mother. Abortion is an unwritten holocaust, allowed by a society that is either uncaring or has been deceived as to abortion's true Satanic nature. It is in our best interest as a society to outlaw abortion and punish doctors who perform them if we don't want God to withdraw his blessing from America.; 0
"Abortion is the taking away of life. Conception creates a living child and abortion kills that child. It is no less than murder, it should be judged no differently than infanticide. What difference lies between the mother who drowns her baby and the mother who aborts? This is the life of a helpless being that each is ending.; 0
"A child is created at the moment of conception. It has a heart and a soul and to have an abortion is murder. All people deserve the right to life and just because some teenage girl makes a bad choice does not mean that a baby should die.; 0
"Abortion is, in my opinion, the only choice when you find yourself with an unwanted pregnancy. I feel that when educating our children about sex and its consequences, abortion should be included as an option for birth control. I believe that any woman who is raped should have an abortion rather than having a child that reminds them of their pain or giving the child up for adoption. I also feel that there are not enough abortion clinics in our country. I feel that abortions should be made more affordable so that all women, rich or poor, can more easily use it when needed.; 0
""Life is sacred. In the Bible it declares ""thou shalt not kill."" To abort a fetus is to kill an innocent and living human being. No one should have the right to take the life of another, even if it is growing inside of them. Babies can feel and respond to outside stimuli very early in pregnancy, even before the three month mark which is when most laws place the deadline for abortion."; 0
"Abortion is murder. When you are aborting, you are taking away a life that may have had a wonderful future. Abortion should not be legal because it is not fair for a baby to have their life taken away, by someone else's decisions. If the person didn't want the child, they should have taken better precautions. Now they have to face the consequences.; 0
"There are too many kids that need to be taken care of already, and if we can control the population, we might as well. Abortion saves time and energy when it comes to the cost and effort put forth to raise a child.; 0
"I am pro-life because I believe that we become sentient beings from the moment of conception. As humans it is immoral to kill another human being - this is called murder and puts you in jail. This concept should be no different for a fetus. A fetus has as much right to live as anybody else already living.; 0
"Abortion is one of the core beliefs our Founding Father had, but never wrote about. Our history is clear that our liberty is based on a freedom from encumbrances placed on us by a well meaning, but potentially wrong government. A woman's right to control herself and her body is the final incarnation of those beliefs. It is the recognition that governments have proper limits on their ability to invade our homes, our minds, and our bodies. While the nature of abortion have moved from the clinic entrance to the pill bottle, much still needs to be done to insure this basic right remains protected in the future.; 0
"Abortion gives a woman the right to control her own life. It ensures that a woman does not have to spend her entire life reminded of a mistake that she made. It is a simple solution to a not so simple problem. Abortion gives a woman the chance to move on from past mistakes and not have to live with the consequences. Having a child is not right for everyone, this is one solution.; 0
"I think that any pregnancy needs to be carried through to the end with no outside interruption of the process. In order for this belief to be covered by laws, I would have to blanket the whole process as bad or specifically decide which situations to exclude as bad, like medical necessity or rape cases. But all that matters is that when life is started, at conception, that life has the right to fully run its natural course. There is no gray area and the process of abortion must be fully condemned.; 0
"Abortion should be a choice that we have in life. If it is not the 'right time' or if something was 'wrong', abortion could be an option. Women should have a choice to terminate the pregnancy if it doesn't fit their present life situation. By having abortion as an option, there wouldn't be unwanted or uncared for children to worry about in the world.; 0
""Abortion: AKA murder. Your unborn child has no defenses, cannot speak out in its own name, cannot tell you how much it wants to live. Abortion: AKA early term infanticide, should not be allowed to continue one more moment. How many partial birth abortions need to be done before the world sees that God is right? The only ""choice"" you need to make is the babies name, upon birth."; 0
"Conservatives who strictly vote for a candidate based on the abortion issue is a conscientious voter. Abortion, the killing of unborn children, is the moral determinate of the character of a candidate. Any candidate that will defend the life and rights of the unborn is a candidate with the moral standing and righteous that will receive the blessing of clear vision. A person who values life will make all the right value decisions. A candidate's stance against abortion is the one and true test of character, leadership, and value.; 0
"Abortion should be an option. Especially in the case of incest, rape or serious health risk for the mother, I believe that abortion should be permitted. Life should not be regarded as being present until past the twelve week gestational period. A female should not have to be forced to give birth to a child that she did not wish to conceive or which may cause great harm to own well-being. The life of the mother should always come first.; 0
"I think abortion is one's own personal decision and no body should interfere in that. People must be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to have the child or not. There can be several reasons why the person would want to abort the child. So only the parents know better whether it's the right time for them or not, they will be able to support the child or not, etc, etc.; 0
"Abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. Making abortion illegal will only make women more promiscuous and proliferate premartal sex among teenagers because they will abortion as a form of birth control. It is murder and is wrong and immoral. Anyone who participates in abortion should go to jail and will end up in hell.; 0
"My position on abortion is pro-life. Basically, we are taught that life is precious,a gift and to take that gift would be devistating to the young mother who made that choice. If the child is not wanted there are many parents who cannot have a child and would gladly adopt the baby with even the option of keeping the mother in the picture throughout the child's life. Life should not be wasted. If the mother is young and decides to keep the child, it may be tough, but hopefully the father is involved and wants to keep the child also. In that case, it may be a struggle, but as the parents grow, the child will grow to make a strong family unit. Yes, Life should be kept, not wasted.; 0
"While people are entitled to their freedoms, one of our freedoms is not to take another life. Despite the fact that this life is occuring within someone else, it does not give them the right to snuff it out. Life begins at conception, period. If a woman does not want to keep her child, there are more than enough willing couples to take on the responsibility and joy of parenting a child.; 0
"Abortion is wrong. Women who get abortions need to take responsibility for their actions. Just because they were irresponsible doesn't mean that an innocent baby should die! There should be no exceptions for cases of rape or incest as all conceptions are a blessing. Teenagers need to accept responsibility for their actions and raise their children. Instead of abortion, why don't people adopt their unwanted babies out? People who have abortions are selfish people who do not value human life.; 0
"I think abortion is a very pleasant thing. It is certain that all a human being is is meat. A fetus has no worth whatsoever, so it doesn't matter at all if you destroy it. No one should ever have any qualms about having an abortion.; 0
"Every fertilized egg is a baby and has the right to life. This right should trump any wants of the impregnated female and society should protect the baby before and after birth regardless of how unwanted it is. No exceptions should be made for abortion, e.g. rape or incest. Physicians should lose their license to practice medicine and have the appropriate charges filed against them for performing abortions at any stage of pregnancy for any reason, even the females health. Males are equal partners in conception, pregnancy and birth.; 0
"The abortion it such a crime, because when a women decide have sexual intercourse with a men without protection knows that it's almost a sure thing her pregnancy. Besides, all the religions in the world condemn the abortion like a murdering. Abortion is evil, if you support or animate it, your final destination surely will be the hot hell. In the abortion, the surgeon is the executor, and the denaturalizated mother is the stone-cold judge dictating the final solution. Please, don't abort: Let your child born. Give her/him a second chance.; 0
"Abortion is always always wrong. It's murder. Life begins at conception and cannot just be thrown away. Women should have to have approval from her doctor and spouse before she makes that choice. In a perfect world, the government would just ban abortion completely.; 0
"Abortion is evil for a number reasons. First it is a crime against God and Life, because every life has a meaning and is valuable by itself. We have not the right to decide if a handicapped boy is or not happy to be alive, because the ways of God are mysterious. Second it is a crime against Nature, since we are born to breed and multiply: if everybody aborts humans would disappear. And it is a crime against Logic, since there is no reason to abort when there are so many orphanages available.; 0
