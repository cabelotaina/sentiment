"When I first started looking for a cosmetic surgeon I visited a lot of doctor's offices looking for the right fit for me and I found Dr. Burke Robinson's office to be the most supportive and professional choice. I didn't really know what I wanted at the time, just that I wanted to look younger, and the staff there were so helpful in explaining what options I had and what surgeries they offered that I made the decision to get a facelift that very day. Once I had decided what to get, they put me at ease with the process and introduced me to Dr. Robinson. Dr. Robinson was very knowledgeable and explained everything step by step to me so that I knew what to expect. They also had great financing options as well so it made it very easy for me to pay in installments. After it was all said and done, he did a fantastic job on my face, making me look years younger. There really is no question in my mind where I would go if I need further work done in the future and I now tell all my friends considering getting a facelift to go to Dr. Robinson!"
"Dr. Arnold Lurie has been my doctor years. He exhibits the best professional attitude that a patient could ask for. He's thorough and accurate. I never have to wait an unreasonable amount of time, and the office is always extremely clean. His staff is warm and welcoming. When I am there, I have his attention 100% of the time. That is very difficult to find in any doctor these days. I highly recommend Dr. Lurie."
"Dr. Silverman and his staff were nothing short of fantastic. From the moment I entered their office for my consultation appointment, I felt comfortable and at ease. I was a little hesitant to meet with a plastic surgeon regarding elective surgery, but I'm so glad I did. He answered all my questions in a profession manner and never once did I feel pressured into making a snap decision. I would recommend anyone considering elective plastic surgery to meet with Dr. Silverman before choosing a doctor."
"Dr. Hunter is a family favorite of ours. Anytime we are concerned or do not understand things she takes her time to make sure we are assured and all of our questions have been completely answered before we leave her office. She is very kind and very genuine, we never feel that she is not genuinely concerned. The staff is great as well, always pleasant and helpful. We will continue to see Dr. Hunter for years to come."
"Dr. Lacombe is a family physician at the Polyclinic Medical Concorde. He has been my family's obstetrician through three pregnancies, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. With many doctors you get the feeling that they are simply putting in their time for the day, and in their dealings with you they make you feel like a bother. Not Dr. Lacombe. He is unfailingly kind, respectful, and truly wants to help you with any worries or concerns that you may have. "
"Dr. Jugenburg's mission is to strive for safety and satisfaction. When I visited Dr. Jugenburg, he and his team had only my interests in mind and listened to me and my wants and needs before he suggested anything. I am completely happy with my procedure and I could not have asked for anything better. Dr. Jugenburg was so wonderful through the consultations, surgery, and post-op treatment. I have no scarring and feel so much better about myself now. i would recommend Dr. Jugenburg for any cosmetic surgery!"
"My experience with Dr. Ali can only be marked as a positive one. The atmosphere and staff were very inviting and caring and it only reflected more on Dr. Ali. The care and concern which was felt by her was very appreciated and made me feel like she did care about my well being and was generally concerned. I felt more like a patient and not just a medical chart with a concern. I will be keeping Dr. Ali and I encourage anyone else looking for a doctor to look her up. "
"I am pleased to recommend Dr. Howard Silverman, following my successful breast enhancement surgery he performed on me. While I was somewhat nervous at the outset, Dr. Silverman provided me all the information I needed to make an informed decision to have the surgery. He explained all the procedures thoroughly beforehand, and did the surgery exactly as I requested. He continued with follow-up after the surgery in a most professional manner. I am very happy with the results, and will use Dr. Silverman for any other plastic surgery I may decide to have in the future."
"I highly recommend Dr. Lacombe to anyone I know, especially my close friends and family. This doctor is not good, he is fantastic! I have never been treated with such kindness and compassion from any medical professional until I had an appointment with this doctor. He is very knowledgeable, yet humble. As soon as he saw my swollen leg, he became concerned and asked me to take my socks off. He pressed his hands from my thigh and swiftly rand his hands towards my foot. Dr. Lacombe mentioned I had poor circulation since my feet were quite cold compared to my legs. He diagnosed me with diabetes which matched my other symptoms (abnormal insulin levels, constant thirst, etc.) perfectly. How he knows so much is beyond me. It's a wonderful feeling to know that there are dedicated medical professionals who actually care about their patients. Thank you Dr. Lacombe!"
"I found Mediclinic to be the perfect fit for me. I work at a job that often does not allow me to take time off for non-emergency type situations. I needed to visit the doctor for a routine check-up. I was able to make an evening appointment. In fact, this clinic is open from 9:00am until 9:00pm. I was greeted by a courteous receptionist as soon as I walked in. After a brief wait in a pleasant waiting area, I was called back to meet the doctor. Dr. Kriegler was very friendly, and listened to all of my concerns before going through my examination. All of the lab work that was required, was performed on the premises. Mediclinic was a very positive experience for me. I highly recommend it."
"He seems like he knows what he's doing. I know that many females seek plastic surgery due to low self-confidence. Dr. Davis would be a great doctor to turn to when needing a trusting doctor who knows what he's doing. When a doctor is dedicated to his work, that makes the patient more comfortable dealing with decisions involving that doctor. Dr. Davis is a prime example. Although I'm neutral in deciding whether or not plastic surgery is a good thing for people, sometimes getting plastic surgery gives some the confidence they need to get through the day. There are people who get made fun of and put down because of the way they look, and I'm sure, in some people's eyes, Dr. Davis is considered a hero. When you make someone feel from depressed to confident, it changes that person's whole world around. So thank you Dr. Davis. Plastic surgery is an option. Those who choose it probably thank you as well."
"I can't describe the amazing care I received with Dr. Howley. His staff was friendly and understanding and the Dr. himself was gentle and caring.I will not be needing another physician anytime soon."
"Dr. Kriegler seems provides her patients with the same compassion and understanding that she would provide her own family members with. Her educational background and long years of experience are totally impressive. She always makes me feel that I am her top priority and is extremely compassionate and non-judgemental. In my past, I've had doctors who made me feel either like a number, or like an idiot, or both, but not Dr. Kriegler. She is a very good listener and always takes the time to answer my questions. While sometimes, I do have to wait a little bit longer than I'd like, my previous experience as her patient always makes it more acceptable to me than it has been with other doctors because I know how thorough she is and how she takes the time to be certain that any issue I might have will be addressed. "
"My family and I recently switched to Dr. Van Jaarsveldt's practice. What a great decision! His staff is courteous and professional, and do a great job of scheduling appointments in such a way that there is never a long wait to be seen by the doctor. They are also very helpful with insurance claims. The doctor is warm and friendly, and really takes the time to get to know his patients, which is so rare these days! He reviewed all the information taken by his nurse with me, and paid careful attention to all of my concerns about my health. He was never arrogant or condescending, and made me feel like a partner in my healthcare, rather than a bystander who should just do as she's told. If you're looking for a new doctor, call Dr. Van Jaarsveldt's office, you won't be diappointed!"
"during a recent illness i went to st. jude medical center and saw dr joseph longnecker. now nost doctervisits are more of a burden and are not enjoyable, however the care that was provided at dr joseph longneckers office was well above average. the nurses were very polite, and the doctor himself was very knowledgeable. his bedside manner was very good, and he took the time to answer all my questions. "
"I just moved to the area and was looking for a doctor to help me get rid of a terrible cough I'd had for weeks. A friend recommended Spectrum Health. Since they were in my insurance network and Dr. Wasserfall was accepting new patients, I decided to give them a try. Dr. Wasserfall turned out to be one of the kindest, most intelligent doctors I've ever been to. He took the time to listen carefully to all of my symptoms. After a thorough examination he recommended allergy medicine! I was so shocked; I've never suffered from allergies in my life. Turns out he was right and my cough went away almost instantly. Very glad that I stumbled on this practice. I will be sure to try Dr. Wasserfall again next time I'm sick (which I hope won't be for a long time). My only complaint about Spectrum Health is that their URL tries to open an email program instead of going to a website! "
"From the moment I walked into Dr. Valnicek's office, I knew I was in the right place. Like many people, I was nervous and skeptical about cosmetic surgery but Dr. Valnicek helped change my view on cosmetic surgery and made me feel right at home. I definitely didn't want the fake plastic surgery look and Dr. Valnicek knew exactly what I was talking about. I explained how much younger I felt on the inside and how agitated I was with the crow's feet around my eyes. Dr. Valnicek immediately understood how I felt and shared what needed to be done to fix my little problem. Even though I planned on just checking into cosmetic surgery, I was sold. About a month later, I was checking in for my procedure. Dr. Valnicek did a great job of explaining what was going to happen and how he was going to do it. And wow, the results were amazing! Since that time, I've shared my experience with close friends, two of which have chosen to also have elective cosmetic surgery (liposuction and a tummy tuck) and agree the results are astounding. Now, I look the age I feel. My friends can hardly believe how much younger a simple procedure can improve your look and I love getting checked out by everyone at the grocery store again! Take my advice, talk to Dr. Valnicek and you won't be dissapointed. "
"My 11 year old son had a fever, and cough that was keeping him up all night. I took him to see Dr. Desmond Van Jaarsveldt at Four Rivers Medical Group. While children are always getting sick, it is still every parent's nightmare and the worry and stress that something might really be wrong this time, always weighs on one's heart. Dr. Van Jaarsveldt was able to make me and my son feel at easy with his professional manner and confidence. It wasn't a big deal, but sometimes, you just need to feel sure that everything is ok. Thank you Dr. Van Jaarsveldt."
"No complaints at all. Going into a doctor's office isn't the most comfortable experience in the world for me, but Dr. Mausner made me the most comfortable I could possibly be. He was friendly, knew what he was talking about, and I felt that he truely cared about me. If any of my friends needed work done, I would definently point them towards Dr. Mausner's direction."
"Dr Hasell was caring and compassionate. He took plenty of time to explain my procedure and answered all of the questions I had. His staff was also friendly and professional. I would recommend this Dr. "
"Dr. Luna is a great doctor. Not only does he help with my ailment and treat me, but he goes above and beyond to connect with me and make me comfortable. He always takes time to ask me about my life and asks about my grandchildren. The wait time is consistently less than 10 minutes. His support staff is very nice and professional. Even though he is a very popular doctor, he still works me in when I really need to be seen."
"Dr. Brassard was very professional and thorough. I was very impressed by his office and staff. They were all incredibly warm and helpful. I was very happy with the results and I would definitely recommend him."
"As a first time patient of Dr. Arnold Lurie, I was pleasantly surprised to have my visit go so well. The staff was exceptionally polite, the facility was immaculate, and wait time to been seen was almost immediately after I checked in. Dr. Lurie was friendly, very knowledgeable and experienced, and treated me with the utmost respect and compassion. I'm so glad to have finally found a physician I can trust, and take my whole family to!"
"Doctor Brent Howley is a top-notch cosmetic surgeon and it was my pleasure to have been one of his patients. Doctor Brent took the time to listen to my expectations of the results I wanted to achieve through cosmetic surgery. He was courteous and professional in answering my questions regarding the surgery, and really took the time to make me feel comfortable when discussing the procedure and outcome with me. He explained the things I should expect during the surgery in a clear, concise manner and made me feel at ease while he discussed possible complications and how he would handle them. I left my consultation feeling very comfortable and prepared for my surgery. During and after my surgery, Doctor Brent was continually knowledgeable, professional and comforting. He made everything seem like a breeze and really put my mind at ease. My recovery was a cinch, and I am extremely pleased with the results I received. Doctor Brent changed my life with his professional knowledge and expertise in the field of cosmetic surgery! I have so much confidence and self-esteem and I really feel like a new woman. I would definitely go to Doctor Brent again, and will be recommending him to my friends and family."
"Dr. Hunter is very knowledgeable and takes the time to get to know her patients, unlike many other physicians. I've never had a long wait time before an appointment, and most times she is right on schedule. During appointments and exams, Dr. Hunter is very considerate and thorough. Both of my children and I see her regularly for check-ups, and we don't plan to change physicians any time soon."
"Dr. Aboolian is a very professional and high quality plastic surgeon. His website is incredibly professional looking and instantly made me feel more comfortable with him. He has performed surgery for numerous contestants from the TV shows "The Biggest Loser" and "Extreme Makeover." Dr. Aboolian has also been named Super Doctor by his colleagues in Southern California. His office offers a number of different procedures for a diverse population. So, whatever you're interested in having done, Dr. Aboolian's office can likely do. He also offers a number of ways to pay for his services, including financing plans for patients. "
"I have been a patient of Dr Angela Mazza-Whelan for 10 years. Dr Mazza-Whelan has always provided myself and my family with exceptional medical care. She is a very skilled practitioner, which shows not only in her posted degrees, and Internal Medicine Board Certified certificates, but also in her hands on, caring, bedside manner. I feel she upholds the company's vision of a "Healthier Hamilton" I highly recommend Dr. Mazza-Whelan to anyone in the community who is seeking a new family doctor."
"Dr. Hassell has been an amazing help to me, he is an extremely well versed doctor whom I would recommend to all of my friends and family! After being passed from doctor to doctor, only Dr. Hassell was able to relieve my constant sinus symptoms. What I enjoy most about him is his holistic approach, his solutions aren't simply prescribing pills, unlike other doctors I have experienced in the past, he searches for the natural, healthy way to diagnose and treat. He is very friendly, kind, and patient, he took the time to listen to me and answered all of my questions knowledgeably. Thank you, Dr. Hassell!"
"Dr. Hunter is a very caring and professional doctor who is a valuable team player in the family practice sector of St. Joseph's General Hospital. She genuinely cares about her patients and is extremely thorough. Dr. Hunter listens and relates well to her patients."
"I went to see Dr. Jaarsveldt as a new patient. I had a really bad cold, so I called and was scheduled an appointment for the following morning. I arrived at ontime and was recieved by a very friendly front desk secretary. She gave me a form to fill out, and I was seen by the doctor on time, only waiting for a few minutes. Dr. Jaarsveldt listened to my symptoms and showed concern. He really cared about my needs. I would recommend any of my friends and family to his practice. He is a great doctor, and has a very clean facility. The practice has convenient office hours and it also accepts a variety of payments. "
"Before going to Lake View Medical Clinic and ending up in the wonderful hands of Dr. Cynthia Nave I suffered chronic migraines that were often times debilitating. Now, after undergoing a few botox injection sessions I can safely say I live a life free from the horrendous pain that they would often cause me. The staff were also incredibly friendly and help; both over the phone and in person. Thank you Dr. Cynthia! "
"Dr. LeBlanc is a truly caring cosmetic surgeon. I consulted with him to improve myself, and he was there for me every step of the way. Not only were the results of my surgery fantastic, but the atmosphere and the interest Dr. LeBlanc took in me were phenomenal. The best part of the whole experience was that Dr. LeBlanc communicated with me at every step of the process: before, during and after the surgery. I would highly recommend Dr. LeBlanc to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery. "
"I started seeing Dr. William Healley in the Primary Care Network as my behavioral health consultant after a friend advised me of his superior health care. I have had uncontrolled panic attacks for a number of years and no doctors that I have seen in the past have seemed to be able to help and many of them seemed to just not care about the horrible effects panic attacks were having on my life. Dr. William Healley seemed to know the illness and it's causes very well and determined that I suffered from bipolar disorder and changed my treatment and I have been free from panic attacks for more than two years now. I cannot say enough to urge you to see Dr. Healley if you suffer as I did from panic or anxiety disorder. Thanks to Dr. Healley I have my life back now. "
"I went to see Dr. Stan Valnicek to have a deviated septum repaired and at the same time decided to have a bump removed from the middle of my nose. Dr. Valnicek spoke to me in terms that I had no difficulty understanding. He and his staff were very warm and made me feel at ease during a time that is normally very stressful. His aftercare was just as caring and my recovery time was minimal with very little swelling or discomfort. I would definitely go to see Dr. Valnicek for my next procedure."
"My experience with Robert Backstein has been nothing but a good one. I went to him for a tummy tuck after I had my first baby. I was very nervous at first but Dr. Backstein put my worries at ease! His positive attitude helped with my anxiety, and he was great at answering all my questions!"
"After visiting Dr. Sheina Macadam's office I feel very confident in choosing her as my cosmetic surgeon. She was very honest in going over my options and just as honest in what wouldn't be an option for me. She told me both the pro's and the con's and we discussed what I would most comfortable with and what would be most beneficial. While going over the different surgical options she made sure I was aware of possible side effects, infections etc and explained to me post-surgical care. I am sure to recommend Dr. Shaina Macadams to anyone."
"When I first decided to get body contouring, I knew that wanted to see Dr. Taranow. He has been recommended to me by numerous friends for his breast augmentation and body contouring work. Initially I checked out his website, I was able to look through numerous galleries to see more examples of his work. I decided to set my appointment for a liposuction, and I was very pleased with the outcome. His office and staff were very inviting, and he seemed to be very knowledgeable about the procedure. The surgery went very well. I have now fully recovered and I look great! I would definitely recommend Dr. Taranow to anyone looking for a great plastic surgeon. "
"My experience with Dr. Leblanc last Thursday was perfect. I was greeted with a smiling face and the lobby was welcoming. The publications were current and the wait was seemingly non-existent. Dr. LeBlanc was extremely professional and knowledgeable. My questions were answered in full and I did not feel rushed. I will absolutely trust my care and beauty in the hands Dr. Leblanc."
"Dr. Arnold Lurie has had much experience in the medical field and I feel very comfortable taking myself and my family to him for any reason. In my opinion, the best thing about seeing Dr. Lurie is that the appointments are very flexible and easy to schedule and the wait time is minimal. I have never had a better experience when it comes to a doctor."
"I have been a very loyal and satisfied patient of Dr. Benoit LeBlanc for about five years now. I was referred to Dr. LeBlanc by a close friend, and initially met with him to discuss a breast augmentation surgery. I was immediately impressed with his professionalism and the care he took to ensure my comfort. After my surgery, I was very pleased with the results. I had minimal scarring, and I healed very quickly. Two years ago, Dr. LeBlanc performed liposuction and a tummy tuck, and I was again amazed at the results. He has a wonderful bedside manner, and truly takes the time to talk to his patients and get to know them. In the operating room, he has a natural talent, and his work is superb. I have almost no scarring, and the bruising/discomfort after both of my procedures was nothing like what I anticipated. In the future, should I ever decide to have more work done, there is no other surgeon I would trust with my body than Dr. LeBlanc. He is, in my opinion, one of the best cosmetic surgeons in the country. "
"Dr. Elahi is amazing. He was very patient with all of my questions, and did better than I ever could have hoped. I never thought that I could look this good. I feel like my life can finally begin now, thanks to him."
"I would highly recommend Dr. Hunter and her practice. She is knowledgeable and has excellent staff on hand. Her practice is one I would trust for myself and my family."
"Dr Richards was a joy to have as a practitioner. From the start, he was calm and helpful while listening to my needs. I can't express how pleased I am with the whole process and how it went. The surgery was very successful and I was left with little swelling and recovery was a breeze. He was very communicative and allowed me to ask as many questions as I needed in order to feel comfortable. His expertise was comfort enough at first, but as I got to know him as a person I felt so much better when the surgery came around. I would recommend him to anyone looking for a plastic surgeon."
"I was extremely satisfied after I was treated by Dr. Georgiana Barnardo at the Lakeside Medical Clinic. She was very thorough and understood my problems. She was immediately able to understand what I was saying and form a hypothesis. She seems to be very well educated in her field. She ran a test and found that she had been correct all along, and she wrote me a prescription. I am already feeling better! "
"From the start of our consultation, Dr Silverman was extremely helpful and informative, providing me with credentials and expert advice. There are an array of services that he provides so that you don't have to go to multiple doctors. I know I feel a lot more comfortable having my breasts augmented by the same doctor who did great on my laser hair removal. "
"Recently, I had been looking for an expert doctor for some work that I have been looking to get done for while. I met what felt like dozens until I found Dr. Cynthia Nave. An expert in her field, she made me feel at home from the moment I walked into her office. I had the UltraShape procedure done and was so satisfied with it that I went back for some BOTOX work around my brow and smile lines. Dr. Nave is a wonderful woman and an even more wonderful doctor. I would recommend anyone in the area and those who are even relatively close to the surrounding area's to go visit her about anything they offer that you have been considering. I guarantee that if you weren't sure before hand you will be after the meet."
"Dr. Hasell is a fantastic physician. I went in for a relatively routine procedure and was still very nervous. However, both he and his staff were able to explain to me exactly what they were going to do and there was no need to worry. He and his staff are also very personable, and it is evident that they are truly passionate about their jobs. It was the most comforted I've ever felt at the doctor's office, and the procedure went smoothly. I highly recommend him to anyone needing cosmetic surgery."
"Dr. Viviers and Associates are the best in the area. The receoptionists were kind and easy to talk to, the wait was one of the shortest I've had, and the doctor we direct and to the point without using too much medical jargon. I would recommend them a your family doctor and even go as far as to change doctors to this office. Two thumbs up!"
"Dr. Mausner and his staff are fantastic! They offered the best customer service I've ever received from a doctor's office. From scheduling my appointment to pre-op procedures to the day of the surgery everything was handled in the most professional manner. I was referred by a friend and will definitely be recommending his practice to all my friends and family. His work is impeccable! No one knew I had the surgery done! Dr. Mausner communicated every detail of my surgery with an unmatched bedside manner. His talent as a surgeon plus his clean, well run practice is what will keep me and my family coming back for generations to come!"
"Knowing that Dr. Wolf has over 18 years of experience as a plastic surgeon made me feel more at ease about having my deviated septum corrected. During our initial consultation, Dr. Wolf was very patient and seemed to show a genuine interest in all of my concerns, and took the time to thoroughly explain how the surgery would work, how long it would take to recover, possible complications, and other information that I felt was important to know. After the surgery, Dr. Wolf came to see me at the the bedside to follow up with me and see how I'm doing, which was a great gesture that I had not expected. Two months after the surgery, my nose looks good, I can breathe great, and I can honestly say that Dr. Wolf did an outstanding job!"
"I have a been a long time patient at the Mediclinic in Saskatoon for over 10+ years. In all that time the staff at the medical office have always been exceptionally kind and competent in every area of medical procure they have performed. They have reasonable billing prices for the procedures and will work with you to pay off your bills if you are having money issues. My doctor, Johann Kriegler, has been my personal physician for the entire time and I would warmly recommend him to my friends and family and have in the past. Dr. Kriegler always listens to my questions and answers them in a way that doesn't lead to confusion or misdirection, and I love that about him. He is honest and forthright, making our doctor/patient relationship easy and communicative. I would give the medical office a 10/10 and Dr. Kriegler a 15/10 because he really is the kind of doctor that makes going to the doctor a pleasant experience. "
"Two weeks ago, Dr. Mark Mausner changed my life forever. I had Blepharoplasty and Restalyn injections for the first time. I can not believe how amazing I look! Dr. Mark Mausner was recommended to me by my sister who had the same procedure done and looked at least 7 years younger. I must admit I think he did an even better job on me. Dr. Mark Mausner was so comforting and reassuring about both the procedure and its results. He understood how my face was affecting how I felt about myself and took time in the initial consultation to help me develop a yearly schedule to keep my looks fresh and keep the cost affordable. His office staff is professional and friendly, and never waited longer than 16 minutes to see him. I would highly recommend Dr. Mark Mausner to anyone who is looking for a knowledgeable, skilled Plastic Surgeon who truly cares about his patients and wants to develop a long term relationship. "
"Dr. Brent Howley is very kind and attentive. He is very knowledgable in the medical field and helpful when it comes to approaching him for advice. He saw my son right away when he was really sick, even though i did not have an appointment, which I really appreciated. He's always very thorough when diagnosing, which is great because some doctors out there don't care enough to take the time to really understand what is going on and prescribe something that won't help the condition."
"Best plastic surgeon in the USA! You will not be dissatisfied with his work. I was extremely pleased with my breast implants and rhinoplasty. You know he's a good surgeon when it doesn't take very long to heal. I would hands down recommend Dr. Bensimon to anyone who asked."
"Thank you Dr. Elahi, Since my Abdominoplasty i look the way i have been wanting for years! I feel and look like i am 10 years younger. My husband cant keep his hands off me! You have changed my life. The staff made me feel so comfortable and the whole proceedure was explained so there were no suprises. I have tried everything to get the look and feel i wanted. Now i have the confidence to wear the cloths i wore before my kids. Thank you for your wonderful work! Cindy Monsato."
"I went in to see Dr. Aboolian after a friend recommended him for his bedside manner. I initially went to see Dr. Aboolian just to get a consultation for a mini face lift. The girls at the front desk were very welcoming and even remembered my name. I was promptly taken to a consultation room and only minutes later Dr. Aboolian arrived. Unlike most doctors, he did not seem overwhelmed or rush the consultation. He took time to answer all my questions thoroughly and made me feel at ease while keeping a professional demeanor. After he was informed of what I was looking for and an examination, he told me that he did not feel that I needed a mini face lift that he would recommend a dermapeel instead. I found this very enlightening because even though he would have made more money off of the procedure I came in for, he put that aside and was honest with me. I will only go to Dr. Aboolian for any further procedures I may need. He really made me feel important."
"Dr. Forrest is an exceptional pediatric plastic surgeon. I simply cannot say enough about the quality of his care and degree of professionalism. He is highly experienced in his field, and his level of expertise quickly puts his patients and their families at ease. While being highly professional, he is also incredibly down-to-earth and patient. He takes the time to answer questions and provide information in a compassionate manner. His work truly speaks for himself, and the results far exceeded our expectations. He is highly regarded in his field, and for good reason."
"For most of my adult life, I've had self confidence and body-image issues. About six months ago, a friend suggested I make an appointment with Dr. Douglas Taranow. I was nervous; the idea of getting cosmetic surgery seemed extreme and I wasn't sure I was prepared to risk something going wrong. Dr. Taranow put my mind at ease. He had an answer for every one of my questions, and after hearing him explain how low the risks actually were, I was ready to set an appointment for breast augmentation surgery. Now I have amazing confidence that I only dreamed of before. Dr. Taranow did an incredible job, I don't even have any scars from the surgery! This procedure really changed my life and I wholeheartedly recommend him if you're considering getting cosmetic surgery."
"I just moved to the Vancouver area, and I was worried about finding a primary physician. West Coast Family Practice Centre made me feel right at home in an unfamiliar town! After filling out the usual background paperwork, and the vital checks, I met Dr. Ayling. He was great, took time to answer all my questions, and I never felt rushed. He has a very calming "bedside manner." I would be happy to recommend Dr. Ayling or any of the other physicians at Westcoast Family Practice Centre!"
"Oh she is just the best doctor I have ever met. so friendly and smart and very kind. explains a lot on the condition you have and further provides useful information and stuff that I can do at home to make sure that I fell comfortable. I definantly will go back to her. She answered any question I had and was more than willing to accommodate. further she actually cares about her patients and always on time. which is really good. "
"I recently had the privilege of going to see Dr. Penelope Stalker who practices with the Broadway Family Physicians. First of all, I was very impressed with how quickly I was able to get in and see Dr. Stalker for a medical issue that I would rather not mention. I called for an appointment on a Friday and was able to get in to see her by Monday the next week! Secondly, I was very pleased with how sincere and compassionate she was regarding my circumstances. It has been a long time since I have gone to see a doctor who has taken the time to understand my situation and work out a solution that is right for me. Needless to say I will definitely go back and see her again."
"I needed to see Dr. LeBlanc for some medical issues I had been having. I phoned the clinic the schedule one in, and the office staff were professional and knowledgable. I was able to get an appointment within the week. When I arrived for my appointment, the staff was again professional and friendly, and the nurse came to get me quickly so I didn't have to wait long. Dr. LeBlanc came into the room within five minutes, listened to my concerns and addressed each concern thoroughly. He also asked several questions and recommened a medication-in which he called in to the pharmacy right away. I appreciated that I was able to see the doctor, and not some PA in his place. After all, I pay for a DOCTOR appointment, not a PA. It's been one week since my appointment and I am feeling great!"
"Not only a doctor but a friend! One may think that going to the doctor is a pain, and not something to look forward to, but with Dr. Kriegler I get wonderful service and she treats you like a friend, we can talk easily and openly. It is the most comfortable clinic environment I have seen in a while. Dr. Kriegler is very understanding and intelligent about my medical conditions and questions and just knows the best thing to do. When I call in when she is not available, she gets back to me ASAP, and I can also just expect the best from her. "
"Dr Eric Bensimon was recommended to me by 2 of my friends. He was very professional and very caring at the same time. He provided me with fantastic advice to help me look younger and more vital without the fake overdone look. He suggested subtle changes that peeled back the years from my face. Even my husband, the skeptic, was amazed at the change but yet was unable to identify just what had been done. I would recommend Dr Bensimon to everyone! I Love my fresh younger look!"
"Dr.Greyvenstein's practice is at Circle Medical. He is a very good doctor. He runs his practice with the utmost care. Dr.Greyvenstein was very attentive to my needs. He tries to make sure he was enough time to answer your questions.He is also not rude when talking to you. Despite having many patients the day I came in, he sat aside enough time so he could answer my questions directly. I did not have to spend a lot of time with a nurse or medical assistant; Dr.Greyvenstein attended to me within ten minutes of me going to the examination room. I highly recommend Dr.Greyvenstein and his practice if you are looking for a great primary care practitioner. "
"I made an appointment with Dr. Taranow at the suggestion of my orthopedist. I had very large breasts - 32DDD - and I had quite a great deal of pain in my back and shoulders, and recurrent numbness in my arms. After years of ortopedic and chiroprctic treatment, my orthopedist finally suggested that my large breasts might be the problem, and he referred me to Dr. Taranow. At my first appointment, I was embarrassed, but Dr. Taranow made me feel comfortable and the exam was not nearly as awkward as I expected it to be. Dr. Taranow concurred with my orthopedist that my breasts were causing my pain and numbness, and we decided on an "after" size, and scheduled an appointment for the surgery two weeks later. I am now a couple of months post surgery and I could not be happier. I came home the day after surgery, and my recovery was fairly uneventful. All of the stitches were internal and dissolvable so I didn't have to go back to have stitches removed, but Dr. Taranow did ask me to come back a couple of times so he could check on my progress. The scars are healing nicely, and are mostly hidden, and I am loving my new 32C breasts. The back and shoulder pain and the numbness are gone, and now I can wear the cute little tops that I never could wear before. I think Dr. Taranow did an amazing job with my surgery, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. "
"I couldn't be happier now that I've discovered "More than Medication" and the wonders of the information available! I have had a long history of struggling with stress and a lack of energy, to the point that I finally began consulting a doctor two years back after things became significantly more difficult following a life-altering family crisis. We've tried several treatments, including medications, and I've seen therapists and psychologists. Though some things have helped, I never felt as if I was in control of the issue myself. "More than Medication" has aided greatly by giving me a great source for my own research and readily available support groups. While still working with my therapists, this site has given me another source of help. Dr. Jablonski is the very reason I have been introduced to these new programs and outlets to assist in alleviating my anxieties. Thank you, Dr. J!"
"I am very pleased with the service and results I received at Dr. Backstein's practice. I was treated with respect and confidentiality throughout the whole process. The staff is kind and very accommodating. Dr. Backstein was very honest with me and possessed an excellent bed side manner. I would definitely recommend him and his practice. "
"I went to Dr. Hasell's office three months ago because a friend recommended him to me. I have always had trouble with the way my nose looks and it had started to affect my breathing. After a brief consultation I was told what to expect and I set up the procedure. The whole process was simple and my surgery was successful. I now look much better than before and I can breathe just fine. I would recommend him to anyone seeking plastic surgery."
"Stan valnicek is a really good surgeon. He is very professional and was very careful. He has a solid background and has many years experience. I recoverd from the surgery on my face very quickly and you can hardly tell i had anything done to my nose"
"Doctor Aboolian is a rare breed of doctor. In my experience, he is the gold standard for doctors. He is calm and confident, focuses on using medicine to make life better, and can explain really complicated topics simply and openly. His clients are elite, and that's only fitting - Doctor Aboolian is about as elite as they come. Cosmetic surgery demands the best doctors and surgeons with the most experience and deepest intellect. They also have to understand what me, as a patient, feels from initial consultation to post-op. This doctor's worth it."
"Doctor Aboolian is a board-certified plastic surgeon. I decided to have my cosmetic surgery performed by him after reading a number of reviews by his patients and investigating his medical credentials. I was impressed by the number of glowing reviews and his academic background and made an appointment. I'm thrilled with the results! The staff were all wonderful and allayed my nervousness and jitters. The offices are pleasant and enjoyable to be in. After my initial consultation, I knew I had made the right decision. Seeing the final results definitely confirmed that."

She is very smart and knows what she is talking about.Dr.Ali is also very patient, interested to hear you out and doesn't rush you just to get to her next appointment like most other doctors do. I'm for sure going back to see Dr.Ali"
"Finding the right doctor is a very difficult process because not only do you need someone who does good work but you also need someone who you feel comfortable with. Dr. Richards is amazing! He made me feel 100% comfortable with him doing the procedure. He was very upfront and explain everything to me so that I could understand what was going to happen. I also appreciated the fact that he gave me his honest opinion so that I would not end up having something done that would leave me looking a mess. After having everything done I'm 200% satisfied with the results and I will never go to another doctor. "
"Before I visited Dr. John Hasell, I was painfully aware of the size and shape of my nose. I had been teased incessantly as a child about it, and my high school years were a nightmare of constant harrassment. Consequently, I was timid, insecure and ashamed of my looks. Dr. Hasell was able to restore my confidence and dignity, and literally changed my life. I am now in college, and enjoying something I never had before--friendship, respect and fun! Thank you Dr. Hasell!"
"Dr. Karima Ali has been our family physician for 14 years now and we have been nothing but extremely satisfied! Unlike other doctors, Dr. Ali takes his time to truly get to know our family and children, and in doing so, has been able to gain our trust in him and his diagnosis'. From the simple flu, which my four children get often, to broken bones and blood work, my family has never had one single complaint. When you enter the office, the staff is very friendly and willing to accommodate you in any way necessary while you wait. They have a plethora of magazines, books, and children toys to keep everyone busy. As a parent, I am thankful for a doctor like Dr. Ali and as a patient myself, I have never had one complaint. Keep up the good work doctor and we'll see you in 6 months for our check ups!"
"I had an excellent experience with Dr. Francois Lacombe at the Polyclinique Medicale Concorde. It has been a delight working with him during the births of my children. He has a wonderful bedside manner, good hours, and an excellent network of referral services when he is unavailable. For those seeking an obstetrician in the Montreal-Laval area, I would highly recommend Dr. Lacombe. "
"I was very happy with the clinic and Dr. Martin Jugenberg. They all made me feel as if I was at home and didn't let the littlest thing pass without explaning it to me. After my surgery I was given after care notes in easy to understand even for my husband to understand. They also called the next couple days after surgery to make sure I was doing ok and if I have anymore questions. The best and wouldn't go any where else!"
"My son had been fighting a cough for several weeks before we decided it was bad enough to see a doctor for it. We were a little worried that he may have bronchitis. At 2 years old, you wish your kid was not sick at all and you are almost scared for them. Unfortunately we were new to the area and did not know any doctors in the area. Since being here though, we had established a number of relationships that I would consider friends. When we asked around, Dr. Lacombe's name was very popular among the results. We felt that if others around us were having good experiences with him and how he handles the children, then it can't hurt for us to try. I was still hesitant though as I have had very negative experiences with several other doctors. When I made the appointment, the nurse was very cordial. From the moment I walked in the door I felt at home rather than a doctor's office. They had all up-to-date equipment for many types of medical appointments. The nurses that built a chart and asked my son questions were very nice and knew how to work with kids. Dr. Lacombe was one of the nicest doctor's I have ever worked with and after a few quick tests he knew what was wrong with my son. He gave my son a sucker and a smile and made my son and I feel a little more comfortable. He prescribed us some antibiotics and his cough was cleared up in about 3 days. I would definitely recommend Dr. Lacombe. I have two other children that will be seeing Dr. Lacombe as well as my wife. It will take some convincing on her end, but I think that I can win her over. I have done it once before! Thank you Dr. Lacombe and staff! You made us feel very welcome in an area full of strangers. We look forward to seeing you again next time one of our children is in need of medical care."
"Dr. Healley has been my families primary care physician for many years. Caring for all 5 members of our family Dr. Healley and his staff have become like family. We never have to wait very long at our appointments. His office is always clean, warm, and comfortable. Dr. Healley is always up beat and friendly and conservative with his prescription writing. He's been a wonderful doctor for my family for many years and will continue to be so for many to come."

Dr John Keller is board certified and experienced in his field. He is available for appropriate consultations for your cosmetic surgical needs."
"I was hesitate about seeking a cosmetic surgeon because I was worried about cost, recovery time and risks. Dr Aboolian and his staff immediately set my mind at ease. They thoroughly explained the facelift procedure and layed out everything from pricing to the surgery itself to the recovery process. Best of all, they kept in contact with me after the surgery to make sure everything was going as expected. I am absolutely thrilled with the results and would recommend Dr Aboolian to anyone!"
"When I first met Dr. Jablonski, I was very unsure about what to expect for my family. I was scared at the idea of a new doctor that may not understand my personal needs or the needs of my children. But, he made me feel right at home, like I was visiting with a neighbor. He helped me to feel comfortable with myself and take charge of a healthier, more positive lifestyle, and showed me ways that I can teach my children to be healthier, too. Dr. Jablonski helped me gain control of my daily stress and gain a true sense of wellness. We went over my eating and sleeping habits together, discussing what was healthy and conducive to my busy life at the same time. I have made some very giant steps towards leading a healthy lifestyle for myself and my family, and I have Dr. Ted Jablonski to thank for that!"
"Dr. Nave was a pleasure to have as my physician. She was very professional and understanding, and was able to answer any questions I had about the process. I received a botox injection, and the surgery site healed very quickly and safely. I would definitely recommend Dr. Nave to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery. She is very knowledgeable, undestanding, and professional."
"I went to the doctor today and saw Dr. Karima Ali.The office was busy,many people waiting.My wait time was minimal,no sooner that I signed in,they were calling my name.The doctor smiled when he talked and was friendly.He complemented on my blouse that I was wearing.When I told the doctor my problem,he was very concerned and he asked many questions and covered all the bases.And turns out that his diagnosis was correct.The medicine I took cured my problem.This is the best complete experience that I have ever had with a doctor.I will keep him as my regular doctor."
"Overall, the attention that I received from Susan Hunter and her staff was great. Upon entering the office, I did not feel stressed in any way. The people there are friendly and helpful rather than irritable. The staff does not interrogate you to make you feel uncomfortable in any way. I have been to too many other practices that have terrible environments; the office is always crowded and noisy, and the place isn't terribly welcoming. When coming into Susan Hunter's office, there is a warm atmosphere filled with friendly people. Susan herself is a fantastic doctor. All of my children feel comfortable around her, and they are not afraid to talk to her about any problem. Because of this, my they can get the proper attention that they need. She has always provided the best options for treatments, keeping in mind the budget that we follow. If we did not have Susan in the area, then we may never get better and still keep our wallets! When a member of my family is sick, I know that I can rely on Susan Hunter and her family practice to give the care that is needed."
"Dr. Taranov was absolutely wonderful! He and his staff are efficient, knowledgeable and friendly. Dr. Taranov makes me feel as though I truly am important, and remembers many things that we have talked about, which shows that he respects me as a client, as well as a friend. He is very confident in his treatments, and I am as well, as I have had zero problems after any of his visits. I am a loyal customer and anticipate that I will remain one for life. "
"As a woman looking to get plastic surgery, feeling comfortable is very important. Dr Brassard and his staff went above and beyond to make me feel at home. I can't say thank you enough. The price was great and the results are fantastic. If you want a professional who knows how to treat people, then Dr Brassard is the way to go. "
"The teenage years can be especially cruel, especially if you're a girl with a crooked nose. My parents could not afford the cost of rhinoplasty but I knew one day I would have surgery. When I graduated from college I decided to take the plunge and call Dr. Valnicek. He listened to my concerns, showed me some before and after photos of his patients. The cost of the surgery was very reasonable. His staff was very caring and considerate. It's been three months since my procedure. I'm completely healed. I love my new nose! "
"Dr. Pierre Brassard is a truly amazing doctor, and you can tell he really cares about his patients. I went to him for some plastic surgery, and he made sure everything was right and that I was satisfied, and treated me with respect. I felt great after the operation, and Dr. Brassard made sure everything was done right. He does very high quality work, and guided me every step of the way after my surgery. It was an amazing experience, and I would definitely recommend him to a friend."

"I went into the carpedium clinic under dr blanc to get facial surgery. I did not like the way that my nose was shaped. I say horror stories on television such as mr. jackson where plastic surgery made people even uglier. However, mr. blancs surgery helped me to look much better. He turned my nose from a beaky to a straight one. unlike other plastic surgeons, who try to tell me what to do dr blanc allowed me to say how I thought it should be done. I think that was one of the main reasons for sucess... the considerate nature of the doctor. "
"Dr. Susan Hunter is an excellent physician. As one of her patient's I feel I am in good hands. Whenever I visit her practice, the staff is polite and friendly. The office area is organized, clean, and quiet. Dr. Hunter treats me in a very gentle manner whenever I go to see her.

He addressed every concern I had with in-dept information that really helped me through this process. His personable nature and extreme expertise in the plastic surgery field convinced me to return to Dr. Robinson for any future work I need done. Overall, a great doctor who made my experience as pleasant as it could be."
"Dr. Lacombe is such an amazing doctor. He has been a family physician for so long that I feel very comfortable and I always listen to his advice. During my pregnancy, he was very supportive and helpful when he spoke with me and my husband.There were also times that I needed an urgent appointment and he was always available to tend to my worries and needs. He made sure that he was with me during every stage of my pregnancy. Since I have delivered my lovely baby girl, I have been recommending him to my friends. I had the best experience with Dr. Lacombe!"
"I normally do not write recommendations however after going to Dr. Tarnows office I felt compelled to write one. His staff is second to none. They made me feel comfortable with the procedure I was having done. Dr. Taranow's bedside manner coupled with his expertise in cosmetic surgery allowed me to be at ease. The work Dr. Taranow performed was excellent and I would recommend him to everyone."

"I want to express my over-whelming gratitude at the loving care I received last week at Assiniboine Medical Clinic. I had a wonderful experience and received intelligent and compassionate care from the moment I arrived. I was greeted with a kind hello by the receptionist, was promptly taken to an interview room by Dr. Russell Albak's nurse, and was treated with dignity by both Dr. Russell Albak and his nurse. I was promptly seen by Dr. Albak. He was pleasant, and took a long time with me reviewing my various symptoms. He was reassuring, and informative. He offered free samples of the medicine that he prescribed. He gave me some literature to help me understand my condition. I felt so completely at ease with Dr. Albak, and I trusted him completely. I would recommend Dr. Albak to all of my family and friends. "
"I've looked all across California for a good family practice that cares for the individual. My family and I have had previous problems with other facilities in the past. A friend recommended Dr. Longnecker, I took my youngest in for a routine checkup and the service and care was expenential. I've recommended to my friends and there experiances seem very much like mine professional, quick, and with great care."
"Dr. Albak is a wonderful doctor. Firstly, he was very timely and did not make me wait very long past my scheduled appointment time. He made me feel very comfortable from the moment I walked into patient room. He was kind and understanding of my questions and concerns and he took his time to answer them in a way that I could understand. I would recommend Dr. Albak to anyone."
"I simply do not have enough good things to say about Dr. Howley. He completely changed how I few myself when he gave me my new nose. I am no longer embarrassed by the huge beak I used to have, instead I have the perfect nose to fit my face. Everyone that he works with are extremely nice and professional and I never once had any misgivings about him. I met with a few other surgeons before my operation, and none of them were as nice or as helpful as Dr. Brent Howley. "
"Dr. Kriegler is a fantastic doctor - very caring, attentive, and detailed in his approach. He never fails to truly listen to what you have to say about your symptoms, unlike other doctors who tend to railroad you over a bit and assume they already know what the issue is before even walking in the door. We have had a great experience overall with this office, even when my son needed urgent care for a broken arm. They got the x-ray done promptly and tried to make him as comfortable as possible. We would highly recommend Dr Kriegler and his personal approach! "
"I was searching endlessly for a professional and friendly plastic surgeon in order to get a breast lift. I knew the procedure is something to be taken lightly, especially since the muscle surround your breast is coming to be cut into. But Dr. Silverman put my mind at ease. He explained to me the different options in terms of an incision (lollipop, anchor, or areolar) and what he felt would best suit me. Dr. Silverman also provided me information on what to do pre and post surgery, and never once along the way did I feel force to do something I did not want to do. He also does procedures concerning the face and body, so after my breast lift, I would love to go back to him and get the rest of my body done. "
"I am new to the area so I have been looking for a new doctor. I got several recommendations to try Dr. Barnardo at Lakeside Medical Clinic. That was a great suggestion! Dr. Barnardo is very smart. He did not rush me through my visit. He answered all my questions. His staff was very friendly. The office was clean. I spent less than 5 minutes waiting for my appointment. Even my wife liked the doctor and she really does not like doctors! I will be going to this office from now on."
"I had a great experience with Dr. Viviers office. The office was very clean and willing to help me with all my medical needs. They are great one on one person facility and they truly cared to help me with all my needs. I would recommend Dr. Viviers office to all."

It is very clean and welcoming and makes you feel like you made the right decision. The equipment is completely state of the art and I have never had an issue with something not working properly. She so is friendly and goes out of her way to make you feel like you are the center of attention. I sometimes have trouble asking the right questions but Dr. Barnardo has no problem talking with me about my ailment and making sure I have a full understanding of what is going on and what the next steps are. She will wait all day and make sure that we are ready to move forward. She makes me feel like I am a member of her own family."
"I highly recommend Dr. Howley. He has integrity, is very honest and friendly. He is a responsible doctor who likes to take care of his patients and gets his job done properly. Every single time I have had the pleasure of seeing him, he has remained consistent, patient-focused and approachable. His staff and facility are also both exceptional. I would absolutely recommend him in the highest regard to anyone on the look out for a caring, reputable surgeon. In fact, I have already sent several of my friends and my family members his way! He is truly a blessing."
"Dr. Richards is fantastic. He was both pleasant and very professional. I felt like he truly listened to what I wanted as well as any questions and concerns I had. Admittedly, I was quite nervice for the procedure but Dr. Richards team made the extra effort to make me feel comfortable and calm. All and all, if I ever need or want cosmetic surgery again, I will definitely be going back to Dr. Richards. "
"I've used Dr. Burke P. Robinson as my primary care physician for two years and have received excellent care. I have multiple health conditions, and one (acid reflux) makes it difficult to treat anything else, as a lot of ordinary medications mess up my stomach. He's done a great job managing all of it and is as personable as he is knowledgeable. Dr. Burke P. Robinson spends a lot of time answering questions, and although he is very tightly scheduled, will always make room for a sick or injured patient. He is also generally quite punctual. He also has filled out various forms for work and sports quickly. Five stars for his treatment. Dr. Burke P. Robinson genuinely is accepting new patients at the moment -- He's so well liked that her current patients keep referring new ones, which is how I found him in the first place. I have PPO insurance and it's never been an issue. His practice gets another star because of the staff -- I've had excellent experiences. The staff has always been courteous, though, and one of hisr staff has done a bunch of wrangling with my insurance company and mail-in pharmacy to get me my medication. "
"I have been self-conscious about my size of my nose since I was a little girl. I went into Dr. Davis' office for a consultation regarding a possible rhinoplasty. During the consultation, Dr. Davis' bedside manner was excellent; he made me feel quite at ease and calmed my fears about the surgery. Based on my experience then I chose to go ahead with the surgery. My results have been stunning! I have never felt so beautiful in my life! Thank you Dr. Davis!"
"Dr. William Healley is one of the best doctors around. He is very knowledgeable and always eager to answer any questions that may arise from his patients. His practice, The South Calgary Primary Care Network, is fully equipped with the best technologies and equipment. The staff is always there to help and is always courteous and polite. You can't find a better doctor, or practice, anywhere else! "
"I am beyond satisfied with the results from my surgery. I sought out Dr. Macadam in hope of getting a tummy tuck. I had recently lost a lot of weight and had annoying flabby skin around my stomach that I could NOT get rid of no matter what I did. She walked me though the procedure. I was taken care of quickly. The healing process was fast and my scarring is very minimal. You wouldn't know I had work done unless you really looked at me. I can't thank her enough for that and my new, totally flat stomach! "
"I went to see Dr. Robinson. First of all making an appointment was simple and I got in within a week of calling. The office was clean, organized and the office staff was very friendly, accomodating and professional. I felt right at home. The new patient paperwork was thorough but not redundant and was easy to navigate through. I had approximately a ten minute wait time before being seen. The nurse was friendly and immediately made me feel comfortable. She had a good sense of humor and was very likeable. I waited approximately 5 minutes between seeing the nurse and the doctor. Dr. Robinson had excellent bedside manner. He explained my options in depth in a language I could easily understand. He took his time to answer my questions thoroughly and didn't pressure me in any way. He was respectful of my wishes and allowed me to choose the course of my treatment. I would definately recommend Dr. Robinson. "
"Doctor Van Jaarsveldt of Four Rivers Medical Clinic was phenomenal. He looked at my son's swollen knee and was immediately able to treat the issue. He said that the bruise was nothing more than the result of a bike fall. (We assumed this, but we worried it was worse, for the bruise was so large). Dr. Jaarsveldt provided us with fast and simple coverage. He made sure we had all of our questions answered. Four Rivers Medical Clinic is the place to go if you want fast, affordable, and easy answers to your medical problems."
"Karima Ali is an excellent doctor. I went to take my children there - and generally, my children are afraid of doctors. Not only was Karima Ali very knowledgeable, she was also very friendly. My children did not cry or whine at all when being treated by Karima. Usually, my children can prove to be quite the handful when going to the doctor's office. Karima was friendly and accommodating, using great technique when interacting with children. However, when she interacted with me, she was very professional and put me at ease. I have been to other family doctors before, and none compare to Karima. I have been displeased with their general negative attitude towards my children, but Karima showed patience and compassion - traits necessary for a family doctor. She was the best family doctor I have had, and I would recommend her to all families. For a doctor that exhibits all the qualities needed to be a successful and great family doctor, go see Karima Ali - I promise you will not be disappointed. Even her support staff were carefully chosen - everyone from the receptionist to the nurses treated my children and me with compassion and care. Excellent service overall."
"I went to see Dr. Penelope Walker and she is by far one of the best doctors I have had the pleasure to visit. She was professional, and seemed to truly care about my medical issues. She helped in a compassionate and very professional manner and I highly recommend her to all my friends and family."
"My family and I have been patients of Dr. Albak's for almost ten years at the Assinibone Medical Clinic. He has always been available to us in any emergency situation, and there have been alot with three sons. He spends the time to find out what is wrong, how we are feeling and what we think is a good medical treatment. He is friendly, considerate and professional. His staff is also friendly, considerate and professional. I would recommend him to anyone as your family doctor. The hours the clinic is available is great plus the walk-in hours are excellent. Assinibone Medical Clinic and Dr. Albak can take care of all your medical needs and emergencies. I highly recommend them to anyone needing a healthcare facility and doctor."
"Dr. Angela Mazza-Whelan is a life saver. I just recently moved into a new neighborhood and my daughter came over a cold so we did a quick search on the internet and found Hamilton Family Health Team and were referred to Dr. Whelan. Not only did Dr. Whelan diagnose the problem, she also helped see to it that my little girl was going to get better. We checked in once a week and was always greeted with a smile. I look forward to seeing my two other sons' in the good hands of Dr. Whelan. Her professional atmosphere I would call comforting to all parents to know that she takes the job seriously. "
"Dr. Tinus Wasserfall (Vancouver BC) is an excellent physician with a great personality. He always seems unrushed during my visits to his office, taking the time to answer any of my questions. His office staff are always kind and considerate. Appointments are always on time, and he's never been one of those doctors who call you out of the waiting room within a few minutes of your scheduled appointment, only to make you sit in one of the exam rooms for half an hour."
"I have been a patient of Dr. Wasserfall for several years now and have always found my problems addressed in a most professional manner. He is an excellent diagnostician and really cares about his patients. He is willing to go out of his way to make sure you receive the best possible care in a timely manner. It is easy to make an appointment, and even if you don't have one but really need to see him urgently, he will squeeze you in for a brief visit. I recommend this doctor highly to anyone looking for a general practitioner. "
"Our daughter was born with a cleft palate. Dr. Forrest and the SIck Kids Foundation were recommended by our family practitioner. Dr. Forrest reassured us and outlined the entire treatment plan.

"Dr. Lurie is an exceptional physician with a successful practice. He has always been very very accommodating with his schedule whenever I need to visit with him on short notice. Dr. Lurie and his staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable with years of experience and offer good advice regarding my health. His office is warm and inviting unlike some doctor offices which helps to put me at ease the second I walk in the door. I know myself and my family are in good hands with Dr. Lurie. "
"Doctor Mark Mausner was very professional during my visit. It was straight to business and I spent no more than 5 minutes in the waiting room. The office was very clean and Doctor Mausner was nice and polite the entire visit. I wont be going to any other doctor for my plastic surgery needs."

He was very helpful, completed everything I needed with absolutely no problems at all was very respectful. I can't wait until our next appointment and I've been recommending him to everybody. So if you're on the edge about your Dr. or just dont feel comfortable. Talk to Dr. Francois Viviers."
"Both my daughter and I see Dr. Longnecker and I have never had a bad experience with him. After you sign in the wait time is rarely over 15 minutes, he is polite, clear speaking, and takes the time to explain everything to me. When my daughter had to go to the hospital Dr. Longnecker was the quarterback of the entire experience. He made sure that the hospital was ready for her admittance and oversaw every step taken. Additionally, I love that he is affiliated with St. Jude, it is exactly where I wanted my daughter to go. (OR if it needs to me more generic...) Dr. Longnecker is a great doctor who has gone the extra mile to not only treat my family and myself when we are sick but make sure we understand what is wrong and are up to date on preventative care. The office staff is friendly and organized. There are never appointment errors or long wait times. I completely trust my family to be in his care. 5 Stars."
"After having twins, my varicose veins were really visible and ugly, I'm only in my twenties and had to wear heavy stockings to cover them, even in the summertime. I made an appointment and went to go see Dr. Luna, because a friend said he helped her mom. I was really nervous that the injections would hurt, but they didn't! Dr. Luna was very kind, professional and answered all of my questions. Several treatments later, I'm out of my stockings and hope to be wearing shorts again this summer. I highly recommend Dr. Luna to anyone suffering from ugly veins that make you ashamed to be seen in public."
"Dr. forrest is a fantastic pediatritian. He goes out of his way to make it fun for the kids and be their friends. He is very through in eliminating every possible way my son was feeling ill to determine the reason, and make sure it wasnt anything serious. Dr. Forrest is the kind of doctor that remembers the name of you and your family without having to look at a chart. He is a shining example of what a doctor should be and an honor to the profession."
"I've had a badly broken nose since the days I was young and wild. I always told myself I would get it fixed when I had some money. But I didn't really know about cosmetic surgery. One of my wife's friends suggested Dr. Forrest, so I made an appointment to see what could be done. Dr. Forrest was very thorough and explained all about the procedure and answered all my questions without acting rushed or put-upon, so I booked the surgery. He had told me I might look like I'd gotten my eyes blackened, but he did an amazing job. There was no bruising and only a little swelling. I don't know that I'll ever need plastic surgery again, but if I did, I would come right back to Dr. Forrest, and I'd recommend him to anyone who asked."
"Dr. Mazza-Whelan and the team at Hamilton Family Health Team are exceptional doctors. The office staff are always friendly and greets you as soon as you walk in the door. If you call and need a last minute appointment they will do their best to squeeze you in, and are very accommodating to all schedules. The practice is neat and organized, as wait times are rarely over 5 minutes. The nurses that start your appointment are top-of-the-line and skillful, and the doctors are incredibly professional. You do not feel rushed as Dr. Mazza-Whelan takes time to listen to your symptoms, and will converse with you regarding her thoughts (not talk "at" you). Dr. Mazza-Whelan will answer as many questions as I can come up with, so I leave the office feeling reassured and informed. If my doctor is booked up and I need an appointment, I have no hesitation to schedule with another doctor, as the communication and atmosphere at the clinic is so friendly I know the doctors will easily share information so that patients can transition between providers smoothly. All in all, this is the clinic I have trusted for years--not only for myself, but for my family."

"Dr. Wolf thank you so much for renewing my self confidence in myself. I didn't think I would ever look normal again until I "Put myself in your hands". You really are a wizard."
"When I needed to have a breast lift done, I went to Dr. Elahi after a recommendation from a friend. I was extremely happy with both the care and the results; Dr. Elahi sat me down and guided me through exactly what I should expect from the surgery, and answered all of the questions I presented. During and after the procedure, he and his staff did their best to make sure I was comfortable and that I was healing correctly. I could not be happier with him, his practice, and his work!"
"When I walk into the office, I was greeted with an unexpectedly warm smile and a how are you from the receptionist. I have a sincere talk with the receptionists and am quickly seen by Dr. Wasserful. He is informative and helpful, and tells me all my options and gives me an unbiased analysis of my options. I am treated quickly and out of the office in a jiffy. This is a great practice, with great service and consistent treatment. Thank You, Dr. wasserful."
"I recently went in to see Doctor Greyvenstein. Overall, it was a very good visit. I arrived, and didn't have to wait to be checked in; I just talked to the receptionist, provided updated insurance information, and that was it. It was quick and easy. I then had to sit down and wait. But the waiting room was nice- it was quiet, peaceful, and well decorated. The chairs were comfortable, there were plenty of different magazines to read, and there weren't a lot of people there. Also good-I wasn't in the waiting room for very long. That's always the part that is the worst for me- when I get stuck in a waiting room for 30 minutes or more. But after only about 5 minutes, the nurse came through the door and asked me to come back. "
"Dr. Robert Backstein's ethics are admirable. The focus of his practice is to ensure that his patients are given an individual approach to cosmetic surgery and are well-informed on the procedures they are considering. By focusing on his patient's individual needs, Dr. Backstein is not only preparing his clients for the physical changes of cosmetic surgery but is also helping them through the psychological process of making such major changes and decisions. Because of his high standards of care, I am confident that Dr. Backstein is the right doctor for me and look forward to working with him in the future. "
"Dr. Keller is great. He helped me through the process and treated me as kind as possible. He was easy to talk to and didn't make me feel nervous. Dr. Keller is an understanding, gentle doctor who will guide you through the procedures with ease. He does a great job and always makes sure you are okay in follow-up appointments."
"Doctor Francois Viviers's office was impeccable. I used to have strokes that would occur within days or months. I was always afraid when one would occur and if it would happen when no one was around. Sometimes I thought I could die within that week because my stress would get so high. Luckily someone recommended me to Doctor Vivier. He was able to give me the name of someone who would show me the right foods to eat to prevent another stroke from happening in the near future as well as lay out all the risk factors for me. Some of which I knew, but most that I had never even dreamed possible. He showed me how to also add multiple applications into my phone that can give me basic information or help. If you have a family member or are in need of someone ASAP then I suggest you call this man! He was so kind and helpful."
"After going through a series of health related issues,And getting no help. The people at South Calgary Primary Care Network were able to find the problem and and get me results. Their staff was very pleasant and helped with every aspect . They were also really helpful with the insurance process. Now I'm back on my feet and healthy . Thanks South Calgary Primary care !!"
"I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Robinson just to get some Botox done on my face and they were able to get me in to be seen that same week. I had never had Botox before, but Dr. Robinson was very helpful with making me understand the entire process. I was very pleased with the results and received a couple follow-up calls just to make sure that everything was going alright for me. Very helpful office staff and an all-around great experience for me. I would highly recommend Dr. Robinson."
"I am a new patient of Dr. Healley and my first experience with him was amazing. I was referred to him by a good friend and I saw him for the first time when I got a bad case of the flu. When I arrived he called my name right on time, something I've never experienced with any kind of medical appointment. I found him to be attentive, knowledgeable, and caring. I could tell he truly wanted to help and he went out of his way to share a tips to get through this flu as comfortably as possible. Finally! A doctor who listened!"
"Dr. John Hasell is a very great doctor to go to. He is very knowledgeable and does excellent work. This is something that he has been doing for over 15 years and I completely trust him to do his best work and help me feel better about some parts on my body. I have no problem going to him and asking for help. Totally worth the money to get someone as experienced and skilled as Dr. John Hasell!"
"Dr. Ted Jablonski, or "Dr. J" as he is sometimes called, is a true medical professional, employing his time and healing touch anywhere he can. Multi-talented, he lends his knowledge and ambition both with individuals in need of aid at nursing homes and sexual health consultations as well as behind the scenes through clinical trials. He is highly attentive to individual needs of patients, seeking to do all he can to help them sometimes searching even when other doctors have quit and is not afraid to admit that he doesn't have all the answers. He always puts his patients first. Dr. J is also one who leads by example, encouraging healthy lifestyles through fun activities he avidly participates in such as cycling and marathon running. Dr. Ted Jablonski truly is a miracle worker!"
"Dr. Ayling is a friendly, personable M.D. with a big smile and warm disposition. He makes going to the doctor's office a joy. He never keeps me waiting and really takes an interest in my health. Dr. Ayling likes to talk with his patients and really listens to my responses. His diagnoses are always on target. Highly recommended."
"We moved into the area recently and did not know many people. My son having mild asthma needed a doctor for a virus he was having. We called several peditircians in the area and were told that they were not accepting new patients on a sick care basis. Well my son needed medical attention and I called St. Josephs. I did not want to have to take him to the hospital because it is expensive. They referes me to Dr. Hunter - I was able to get in for an appointment that day and get my son the care he needed. They were very friendly on the phone and understanding of our needs to see someone today. Dr. Hunter was very friendly to my son and made him feel comfortable by asking him about his new school and paying attention that we had recently moved here. She was able to write the script for the meds we needed and recommended a close pharmacy to where we lived and they called in the scritp for us. I felt hopeless that we would not get my son into an office for his care that day, but the offices of Dr. Susan Hunter gave us the hope we needed."
"I could not be happier with my recent experience at the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Clinic and Dr. Martin Jugenburg. The clinic was sparkly clean and the staff was courteous, discreet and professional. They thoroughly and patiently answered all my questions and cared for me with real kindness throughout my procedure. I healed fantastic and look and feel years younger! I have a new lease on life and a confidence I haven't felt in years! Thank you Dr. Jugenburg for all you have done for me! "
"I was referred to Dr. Wolf by a friend of mine. They had used him in the past and highly suggested his practice. I was able to schedule my initial consultation online and was able to be seen later the same week. Once I was in the office, the scheduling nurse was extremely nice and friendly. After signing in, it only took me a few minutes to be lead to the room to meet with Dr Wolf. He was extremely knowledgeable about my procedure and has done many of them over his long tenure. Recovery time was about what I expected with no complications. Even the followup appointment had the same speed to get in and out, but I never felt rushed. I would highly suggest Dr Wolf to anyone looking to have some work done."
" When it comes to my family's health and well being, I trust the doctors at the Four Rivers Medical Clinic. Dr. Van Jaarsveldt is a well qualified member of the staff that I recently saw during my latest check-up visit. A very knowledgeable and friendly gentleman, Desmond Van Jaarsveldt is a excellent source of medical advice and easy to talk to. His warm, friendly nature makes you comfortable in his office, and he seems genuinely concerned for my family's well being. I recommend him to anyone looking for a good family medicine practitioner. "
"Dr. Hasell and his staff could not have been friendlier. I found his practice through his website and, sure enough, everyone introduced there was who I interacted with. I was first greeted by his receptionist, a very helpful woman (she answered a few questions I had, I was skeptical of the office when I first came). I was led back to his office for a short consultation, and after almost no wait, I was speaking to the doctor himself. He was friendly and informative. He did not make me feel judged or uncomfortable about what I was looking for. I do not regret that consultation, and scheduled a surgery shortly after!"
"My experience with Dr. Valnicek was excellent. I had been suffering from low self esteem due to gynecomastia. After suffering from it for years, I met Dr. Valnicek, who quickly turned everything around. Everything was handled quickly and efficiently and now I can safely say that I'm happier than I ever have been."
"Dr. Aboolian is a miracle worker, he has given me the power to redeem my self esteem. I was in a terrible automobile accident 2 years ago, and was left with signficant scaring on the left side of my face. Dr. Aboolian was recommended by my primary care physician after all other injuries had healed. During my initial consultation; Dr.Aboolian, put my fears to rest; I would not be disfigured for life. He was upfront and honest with me; I would need to undergo several surgeries and there would be brusing and swelling after each. He has rebuilt my nose and jaw line, grafted new skin on my left check, and repaired a prior facial scar. I look better than my old self again. Dr. Aboolian is my savior. I recommend him and his staff to anyone needing considerable cosmetic repair, or just a nip here and a tuck there. "
"Dear Mark Mausner, I can't thank you enough for what you have done for me. You have giving me a new lease on life. Thanks to you and your wonderful staff for fixing my nose. After fixing my nose I can breathe so much better and my snoring is gone for good. Dr Mark you have made my life better and my wife say thank you too. Now she can get a full night of sleep with out me waking her up with my snoring. I would also like to say that the staff and facilities were top shelf and your staff went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and happy. Thank you so much Dr. Mark, I will tell all my friends about you and the wonderful work you do."
"I have visited the office of Broadway Family Physicians and I am highly satisfied with the level of professional medical service by Dr. Penelope Stalker. From the moment I walked into the office, I felt like I finally found a place where attention was given to me. Dr. Penelope is very skilled and informative during each of my visits. All of my questions were answered from Dr. Penelope and I was not whisked out of the door as in the past when I went to ther family doctors. I am very happy that I found a place where I can get quality care for my family and I."
"Having plastic surgery is never an easy decision for someone to make. It is however probably one of the most important ones we make as the results can last a lifetime. Dr. Mausner made my experience so much easier than I thought. He was kind, and the staff was always supportive of me too. If I had to recommend a plastic surgeon to someone I would gladly tell them of my experience with Dr. Mark Mausner. As a patient you need to have complete confidence in your doctor and I can say Dr. Mausner instills that from the first moment you meet him. He helped to give me my life back. "
"Ernst Greyvenstein was amazing they really helped put me at ease in which made it much easier for me to talk about my condition with them. They are also very lively and talkative and made me tell you them as a friend just not as a doctor. I definitely plan on returning to Ernst's practice for any other medical care and need future because of the kind and caring attitudes towards me the patient. Which is especially helpful when you have is awkward condition as I did."
"Eric Bensimon is one of the most helpful and kind doctors you could hope to get. I went in on january 3rd 2012 for a nose job. Here i am today, looking better than ever, and it's all thanks to this wonderful man. He helped me find exactly what would look the best on me and then he perfected it to look amazing."
"I took my son to Mediclinic when I suspected he broke his ankle because it was the closest available medical facility to my house. When I went, they quickly took x-rays, found a break, and got him set up in a cast. Although I'm not happy about my son's injury, the friendly, quick service made the ordeal less difficult. Dr. Kriegler and his nurse are great with kids- they offered stickers, candy, and toys in the waiting room. The facilities are small, but clean and comfortable, and I was told that they have the latest X-ray equipment. I'll certainly go back the next time anyone in my family has an emergency. "
"Dr. Joseph Longnecker is a wonderful physician. He takes the time to explain any concern, that I may have, thoroughly. He is a gentle, kind and caring doctor. I would recommend him highly to anyone. I have taken my children to see him as well. He makes jokes and plays with them to keep their attention off of the examination. If you are looking for a doctor that has a heart and wonderful bedside manner, this is the doctor for you. "
"Dr. Lacombe was attentive to all of my basic needs. He was there immediately to help me through the drawn out process of my pregnancy and in the end he lead me through the initial process of birthing my child. He was calm and collective and I recommend him to anyone in need of a caring family doctor. I feel that he's been fair through all payment processes and I've not second guessed my decision on who I've chosen as my doctor."
"I have been considering breast implants for the last six months. One day I finally decided to make the call to Dr. Howard Silverman. He scheduled a one on one consultation for me the next day and sure enough I was ready to get started. Dr. Howard Silverman personal consultation gave me the courage to proceed to the next step. Throughout the whole ordeal Dr. Howard Silverman and his staff treated me with privacy, respect and care I needed and deserved. I am very satisfied with my new breast. I carry a few of his cards with me at all times and when my girlfriends compliment my breast I hand them a card. That is how satisfied I am with my new and improved breast."
"We just wanted to thank the staff of SickKids for all of their wonderful support throughout our stay with them. Although this was a very stressful time for us, everyone at SickKids treated us so well and were very helpful in answering all of our questions and concerns. We are so thankful to Dr. Christopher Forrest and his assistants! They really took the time to explain everything with the procedure and provided the reassurance we needed during this time. All of our accomodations and the excellent support from the staff members made our experience so much easier and we were able to provide our son with the family support he needed. I can't thank you enough for everything that you have done for us! We highly recommend SickKids to any parent who may be considering having their child's procedure here; the staff is extremely helpful and supportive."
"I recently went in to see Dr. Lurie at the Courtice Health Center because I was having issues with flu-like symptoms. Upon entering the office an assistant greeted me warmly and asked me my name. After a short 5 minute wait I was escorted through the well lit office and into a room where the nurse checked my height and weight. 10 minutes later Dr. Lurie entered the room and asked me what my issues were. He warmly asked questions with great concern, making me feel more at ease. I told him my symptoms included a slight fever, sore throat, vomiting, headache and an aversion to light. He took a swab to get a bacterial sample to determine what my sickness was. After that I left the doctors office for the day and the assistant told me they would call me in the morning to determine what was wrong with me. Total time at the doctors office was an amazing 30 minutes! The next day the Dr. Lurie called me personally and told me that I had a case of strep throat and he was going to put me on a series of antibiotics. He also stated that he'd just call the prescription into the nearest pharmacy and that I could pick it up at any time. Later that day I went to the pharmacy and picked up my meds, followed the instructions on the label and now 5 days later I'm fit as a fiddle! Thank you dr. Lurie, you're the best!"
"My name is Rich. Ever since I was a young kid I was teased relentlessly for my nose. There is what some would call a bump or hook on the top of it. Amy, my girlfriend of 3 years, heard about the great work of Dr. Pierre Brassard from her best friend and encouraged me to do a consult. Let me be clear, Amy loves me just the way I am, but she knows my insecurity and has heard my sad stories. At the consult Dr. Brassard was warm and friendly. He asked me questions about me as a total man treating me as a friend rather than potential patient. He actually suggested that he didn't even think I needed any work done on my nose! Ultimately he asked me if I cared to see any before and after pictures of patients who had decided to get work done. Of course, I agreed to see the pics. Dr. Brassard recommended that I go home, take a week or two to consider what I really wanted to do, and then call back with a decision or any questions. I spoke with Amy and we both agreed that although my condition wasn't life threatening and even though she loved me just the way I was, that if anyone was going to ever going to address this it should be a person like Dr. Brassard who questioned whether it was even necessary. Three days later I called the Dr. Brassard and told him my decision. Two months later we scheduled surgery. It was a conservative procedure and I was able to go home the next day. Amy and I decided to just shape the bump down a bit. Now I still look like myself, only better. My friends tell me I look great but they don't know why! They ask me if I am working out or on a special diet. This is what I wanted all along, yet never even knew before meeting Dr. Pierre Brassard. I was still myself, but a better version of me! Now I have so much confidence and most importantly the voices of torment from my youth are barely audible. Thanks Dr. Brassard for giving me back my joy. "
"Dr. Cynthia Nave has no competition, in my mind, when it comes to cosmetic surgery in the Saskatoon area. I went to her a few months back from Botox treatment and for liposuction. Her staff could not have been more supportive and courteous, as well as Dr. Nave. The liposuction was actually a non-invasive procedure and the Botox turned out great! If you're looking for a cosmetic surgeon and want one that is professional, kind, and knowledgable, look no further than Dr. Cynthia Nave at Lake View Medical Clinic. "
"I visited Dr. Penelope Stalker and I was very satisfied with the way in which she took care of my medical problem. I have a rash on my elbows and she took the time to give me a thorough examination. She asked if I knew if I was allergic to any foods. Then, she prescribed an ointment that would take care of the problem after a few days of use. The most important part of the visit is that she actually took care of me and that I wasn't assigned to be seen by her assistant."
"Dr. LeBlanc provided great service, with very little wait time. I was greeted by a friendly receptionist upon arrival and asked to fill out my paperwork. I was then taken to a patient waiting room within 5 minutes of returning my paperwork. Dr. LeBlanc came in within 5 minutes and took his time with me. He answered all of my questions, addressed my concerns and discussed what kind of results I could expect. He was thorough, respectful, and put me at ease. I high recommend Dr. LeBlanc!"
"I had finally given up my search for a good doctor when I found Dr. Van Jaaraveldt. Practicing with the Lakewood Family Practice Center, I was able to get a quick appointment, and knew upon speaking with the receptionist I had found someone I was going to love. And I was right. This doctor, and his staff,are absolutely amazing. I did not have to wait one minue to see the doctor, and he was so professional and friendly. He took the time to answer all of my questions and seemed so eager to help me get better. There aren't a lot of doctors like that anymore. I feel comfortable and content with the doctor and his staff, as if I am the only patient in the office. It felt like sitting with old friends instead of at the doctor office. I also love the fact I was able to get an appointment so quickly, and the no wait. I have finally found the doctor of my dreams, and I am never going anywhere else again. "
"I recently visited Dr. Burke P. Robinson for treatment. From the time I entered the practice I immediately felt the ambiance of a highly professional environment. My nerves were calmed by the tender care and precision of the staff. Following the procedure, my expectations of the results were exceeded. If you are thinking about having a procedure done, I would highly recommend Dr. Robinson as my physician of choice. "
"My son and I are so happy with Dr. Mazza-Whelan. She is an absolute professional and a dream to visit! Her office is great, all the staff are so nice. And the waiting room has plenty of magazines and toys and a TV to keep the kids entertained. Everyone is so great with kids. My son is never exactly *happy* to go to the doctor, but he is never scared or upset in the office. Her office is part of a larger chain of physicians, but I honestly do not get any corporate vibes off of her practice. Dr. Mazza-Whelan herself is wonderful with kids. Whenever she examines my son, he never puts up a fuss or fight. He's never once cried or been scared. She has a very calming effect upon him. At other doctor's offices, he's cried when having his blood drawn. But Dr. Mazza-Whelan knows how upsetting this is for him, so she draws the blood herself instead of asking a nurse to do it. This has really helped to calm my son down. She listens to both his concerns and my concerns, and she's never led us astray in any treatments. She also gives out lots of free samples for the different drugs (especially nasal sprays) my son needs to help lower the costs for his medications. I highly recommend Dr. Mazza-Whelan, especially for younger kids!"
"I have always felt comfortable at Dr. Sheina Macadam's office. She is extremely knowledgable and won't push you towards options you are not comfortable with. She is willing to sit down over multiple sessions to make sure you get the results you want. And when you go in for your surgery, you'll go into a welcoming and clean OR, and then go into a home-styled recovery room. You won't be disappointed in the results."
"Dr. Tinus Wasserfall is an extraordinary doctor. He is professional and works with his extreme patience. Knowing how doctors are, many just try to rush you out of their offices but when I made an appointment with Dr. Tinus Wasserfall he talked to me in a very professional and patient matter. It didn't feel like he just wanted to get rid of me and go on to his next patient but really wanted to solve my hospitality needs. He diagnosed me and quickly solved the problem at hand. Very good doctor. Very flexible doctor on scheduling as well."
"When I first walked into the office of Dr. Cynthia Nave I instantly felt welcome. The warm inviting atmosphere, and the super friendly receptionist made me feel like I had made the right choice by coming to this office. I was going in only for a simple botox injection in my lips. They set me up an appointment within a reasonable amount of time, and took care of my as if I was going there for many years, even though I was a new patient. I was also extremely happy with the results of the botox, she provided more than outstanding services. I highly recommend going to Dr. Cynthia Nave's office, I know that going to a new place can be difficult especially if you are unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the doctor, but she made my experience easier."
"Dr. Aboolian is a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon known nationwide for his appearances ABC's Extreme Makeover and NBC's The Biggest Loser. Dr. Aboolian specializes in breast augumentation, body and face lifts.If you prefer a non-surgical approach to age defying gravity then, Dr. Aboolian has injectabe enhancements like botox and juviderm or skin peel treatments that can erase years of sun damage off your skin while repairing the elasticity. I choose Dr. Aboolian for a rhinoplasty. This was my second rhinoplasty the first surgeon had difficuly with proper alignment and my nose did not heal correctly. Dr. Aboolian and his staff treated me very well knowing the stress I was under to have this surgery done a second time. My worries were gone when I was able to reveal the bandages and see the beautiful work that Dr. Aboolian. It was fantastic! I am no longer shy and self-conscientious f my appearance and I can't tell you how freeing that is! "
"After having my son, my body was just not what it used to be. Months of dieting and exercise improved my figure, but there were some things I just couldn't fix on my own - extra skin, sagging breasts. After doing some careful research I chose to go in for a consultation with Dr. Martin Jugenburg. Once I met him and his friendly staff I knew this was the place for me to complete my transformation! I had a tummy tuck and lipo with fantastic results, and I WILL be returning to have my breasts enhanced in the future. Ladies - Just go in and meet with him! You won't want go to anywhere else once you do. "
"Dr. Martin Jugenburg has changed my life completely! I was in a terrible accident and was burned severely. I couldn't even recognize myself. I just kept thinking to myself, I am never going to have a normal life from now on. I feared that anytime I went out into public, people would look at me like I am less than human. But shortly after I began to recover, I was informed of Dr. Jugenburg and reconstructive surgery. The thought of surgery scared me at first, but I would have to say it was one of the best experiences of my life. They took such good care of me and worked wonders! Thank you so much Dr. Jugenburg! You don't even know how thankful I am for what you have done for me. I now feel comfortable in own skin again and can enjoy going out into public once again."

"I have had two procedures done by Dr. Burke P. Robinson and both times I have been treated with dignity and respect by both the surgeon and staff. I was quite uncomfortable with the thought of having cosmetic surgery, but felt it was time to finally make some changes that I have wanted to make since I was a teenager. Professional, caring and willing to listen to all my concerns, Dr. Robinson made me feel at ease and took great care of me. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Burke P. Robinson to anyone who is seeking cosmetic surgery."
"Dr. Bensimon was great! I was really skeptical about getting any form of cosmetic surgery at first, but decided to get a consultation at the urging of a friend. Dr. Bensimon answered all my questions and didn't try to push my fears aside. By the time I finished speaking with him, I felt completely comfortable about the procedures and didn't feel like I was jumping into something I didn't understand. Dr. Bensimon was clearly knowledgeable about the subject and had a great bedside manner. Highly recommended for all your cosmetic surgery needs!"
"Dr. Angela Mazza-Whelan is a wonderful family doctor and would be an asset to any family in the Ontario area. Dr. Mazza-Whelan is great with children and parents alike. She is knowledgeable about all kinds of sicknesses and good at communicating with kids about their symptoms. She is also extremely helpful and good at making sure that the kids and parents understand their illnesses and treatments. Plus, like any good parent would know, waiting in a doctor's office with a sick kid is no fun for anyone. Dr. Mazza-Whelan is always very punctual and my family has never had to wait a long time for her appointments. "
"It's nice to know there are people out there you can still rely on. I have a very busy work schedule and only had a small window to come in. I told them I was really strapped for time and they were still able to fit me in. Dr. Whelan took the time to get to know me on a personal level. Then explained everything to me clearly, laid out the steps that I needed to take, and answered all my questions. It's nice to know that I am more then just another patient to Dr. Whelan. "
"Dr. Longnecker is my favorite doctor! His "bedside manner" is unparalleled, making me feel relaxed even in the sickest of states. He is efficient but not cold, which is perfect for me. He comes into the examination room, immediately performs the necessary tests and asks the necessary questions, and, once this is all said and done, he asks me about my family/job/etc. It's refreshing to have a doctor feel like he cares about you, especially in this day and age of managed care making doctors see more and more patients. I highly recommend going to see him for a pleasant experience!"
"Fernando Luna is a godsend. The varicose veins I have are not hurting like they once did. This is truly a gift to me. His practices in medicine are outstanding. I would recommend Fernando Luna to anyone. I was told he is in practice for nearly 30 years. He knows his stuff for sure. I am not one to really write reviews on the computer but I had to this time. I wanted to make sure that everyone who sees this will not hesitate to see Fernando Luna whenever possible. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"Dr. Macadam and her support staff were courteous and very knowledgeable about the cosmetic surgery I was considering. They very clearly outlined the pros and cons of the reconstruction procedure. They took the time to answer all of my questions regarding the procedure and, most important to me, the after care required when the surgery was completed. I highly recommend Dr. Macadam for any type of cosmetic or reconstructive surgery you may be considering."
"Dr. Sheina Macadam is a helpful "do it right the first time" doctor who encourages healthy lifestyles. Dr. Macadam does this by teaching healthy eadtin habits and other such preventative care. All of Macadams patients recieve a full diagnosis and prognosis pertaining to their overall health at the time of treatment. Macadam and her associates always make patients feel at home while providing expertise."
"I've recently had some work done at the offices of Mohammed M. Elahi. The entire experience was pleasant. Dr. Elahi was very patient, answered all my questions and went over different options with me pror to my initial decision to receive some work. He did not in any way attempt to persuade me or coerce me into an operation. He simply presented me with the facts and allowed me to make up my mind. Once I decided, his bedside manner was fantastic. He made me feel very comfortable, and I was highly satisfied with the work. If I ever need another operation, I will use this same doctor. I was taken care of and cared for very well."
"Dr. Mark Mausner is a lovely man. Both my mother and my aunt got nose jobs at his office, and let me tell you, they look stunning. He is a true artist working in the medium that is the human body. In addition to his skill in the field, his office and staff are always very accommodating. The facility is top notch with cutting-edge medical technology -- it just goes to show how professional and truly caring Dr. Mausner is. The staff are always there to help and lend an ear when you need to vent. Having been in and out of the office because of my family members, I have to say that getting surgery there must be a truly remarkable experience. "
"Dr Ayling is a caring and knowledgeable doctor. I had visited his office for an annual check-up two weeks ago. When I setup the appointment, the front desk was very kind and took all the information needed including insurance details and they gave me a favorable time-slot. When I arrived at Dr. Ayling's office, I was surpised at the clean office and the friendliness of the staff. The appointment was prompt and Dr. Ayling greeted me and reviewed each point on my annual check-up patiently and answered all my questions. I would recommend Dr. Ayling and his group to anyone. Keep up the good work!"

They are open late during the week and opened on weekends as well as holiday's. The practice also offers new digital x-ray at the facility, and a lab so you can get many of your needs taken care of at one place. The urgent care can see many of your ailment's keeping you from spending long hours at the emergency room. Dr. Kriegler is wonderful and has great bedside manner, which is important for many people. I would recommend this practice and Dr. Kriegler to any of my family and friends, or anyone who is looking for a great place."
"Doctor Jablonski is one of the most professional and understanding physicians I have ever visited. I have been to doctors that will quickly look you over and hurriedly assign you a general prescription just so they can get on to the next patient. Dr. Jablonsky makes sure that every patient feels as though their needs are important. He listens to everything the patient has to say without ever losing patience. He is a very gentle man. I wish more doctors practiced medicine like he does."
"Since 2005 I have been looking for a medical treatment/checkup facility with both the welcomeness of a family doctor & the professionalism of a respected private practice. This is when I found the Family Health Teams in Ontario. Upon arrival at the facility, I was immediately impressed by the overall knowledge by all staff. I met my doctor, Francois Viviers on my first visit when I had a broken a bone in my foot during a home softball game & he has been my go-to doctor ever since. Francois is a very caring & gentle medical professional. He is very knowledgeable, but does not complicate the visit by any medical jargon & is very straight & to the point in many cases. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a professional & clean facility for family & singles alike."
"I have been a client of Dr. Richards for many years and have always had very good results from his work. What has and continues to attract me most to Dr. Richards is his level of professionalism and the customer service provided by his office. My most recent surgery was about 3 months ago and like always the results were immaculate. I will continue to use Dr. Richards and recommend him to anyone!"
"Dr. Silverman was a big help when I was making my decision about getting cosmetic surgery. He didn't push anything on me, he just laid out what the surgery entailed and what I could except of the outcome. He didn't sugarcoat the risks of surgery but Dr. Silverman was also very reassuring that the risks could be minimized. The outcome was even better than I had hoped and I am very happy with the results. I would highly recommend Dr. Silverman, he was professional, honest and very competent."
"I visited Dr. Albak a few weeks ago when I was experiencing severe pain in my back. The office is always very accommodating to me, and I did not want to have to visit the ER. The wait time was not long, and the nurse continually checked on me, I felt even though I was a walk in, that I was a priority for them. When I spoke to Dr. Albak, he told me that he was 98% sure that the symptoms I was describing were related to a kidney stone. He was undoubtedly right! After all the proper tests and scans I indeed had a kidney stone @ the age of 25! With all of his experience I trust Dr. Albak to guide me in the right direction in preventing the re-occurrence of kidney stones in the future."
"I am in my forties and I wanted to get some cosmetic work done on my face. I searched the internet for information and reviews on surgeons (I did not want to trust my face to just anyone). A lot of people said that they had a good experience with Andre Aboolian. I called and made an appointment and boy am I glad that I did. Andre was GREAT. I felt really comfortable and every question that I had was answered. The staff was top notch as well. I was nervous at first but the work that I had done turned out great. I look ten years younger! I would definitely recommend Andre Aboolian to my friends and family. "
"This Doctor had a nice clean facility, and was charming and well groomed. They took care of my every needs. I would definitely recommend this Doctor to any of my friends. "
"Dr. Lurie was really great! I was called back to see him on time, and he didn't keep me waiting. His entire team is punctial and professional. His receptionists are helpful and courteous, and his nurses are knowledgeable and efficient. He's a thorough, compotent doctor with a great personality. I'd recommend him to any of my friends or family without thinking twice!"
"This doctor is an amazing at what he does. My wife had liposuction done by this doctor and he did an amazing job. It was easy to schedule time with him and he paid full attention to every detail we discussed at our appointment. Staff at this place is very helpful which is also another plus point about this doctor and how he does business. Thanks!"
"I recently underwent a rhinoplasty performed under the expert care of Dr. Eric Bensimon, after having lived with breathing problems for years after a broken nose that never healed properly. I was initially apprehensive about having such a procedure done, but after having my first consultation with Dr. Bensimon I knew I would be in good hands. Dr. Bensimon has a wonderful bedside manner to make his patients feel at ease, especially important to me when you're considering such a serious procedure as facial reconstructive surgery. And he has the knowledge and expertise to leave you feeling confident that you made the best choice. I never regretted for a moment that I chose Dr. Bensimon and the team at Montreal Plastic Surgery. "
"When I went to Dr. Tinus Wasserfall's practice last month, I was pleasantly surprised. The waiting room was very clean and neat. It was very appeasing to the eye. The receptionists were especially friendly and helpful. It was not very difficult to get an appointment with him, as it is with many family care doctors. When I got back to the care room, Dr. Wasserfall was very professional. He made sure that all my concerns were addressed and was very friendly. He even made an effort to connect with me as a person instead of just writing me off as a patient like many other doctors I have visited in the past. I would definitely recommend Dr. Wasserfall to anyone that is searching for a friendly, professional and overall wonderful family care doctor."
"Robinson Facial Plastic Surgery is a great place. When you first walk in, the waiting room is very homey and comfortable. It made me feel at ease. When I met Dr. Robinson himself, he seemed nice and relaxed. It was easy to talk to him about the procedure I wanted. He also had plenty of before-and-after shots so I could see the kind of work he did. He explained the what the procedure would be like very clearly, and when I didn't understand something, he was able to answer all my questions. Overall, I left feeling really good about myself and I couldn't wait to get started. If you are considering any facial plastic surgery, I highly recommend going here!"
"I love this medical office. Issues such as these are so delicate and personal. Both my husband and I felt very comfortable to talk to this staff about our personal needs. I have some problems with unsightly varicose veins and my partner has a lot of hair removal needs. If you are looking for a tactful, confidential doctors office for such issues and want kind, attentive service, just visit the online website or make an appointment. You'll be glad you did."
"Dr. Martin Jugenburg and his team performed my nose surgery procedure (rhinoplasty). I could not be happier with the results. Dr. Jugenberg sat with me and explained the procedure and also showed me "before and after" photos from his previous patients. I felt at ease speaking with him and he had a warm personality. He asked a lot of questions regarding what I had in mind in terms of the final appearance of my nose. He made sure that my expectations were realistic but he also seemed confident that I would end up happy. During the recovery time, the doctor or his nurse would call to check up on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. Dr. Jugenberg seems very professional and knowledgeable in the field of cosmetic surgery. I would recommend him to anyone looking for plastic or reconstructive surgery, and I am thrilled with the results."
"Dr Jaarsveldt is a consummate professional. He has been an excellent doctor for me and my family, and was always up front about my various options/treatments. He is one of those doctors that actually takes time with you, listens and shows that he cares about you as a patient. I can't tell you how rare that is these days. It is clear that he loves what he does and it shows in his attitude. My daughter came to him with a specific, and weird, symptom. Dr. Jaarsveldt not only spent the week consulting with other doctors about it, but called us at home after hours to check up on her. She is totally fine now, thanks to him. I definitely recommend this doctor!"
"My experience with Dr. Hasell and his staff was beyond what you normally get at other offices. I had previously used a different plastic surgeon for other procedures I had done, but based on recommendations from friends I chose Dr. Hassell for my breast augmentation. I was a little seeing a new doctor, but Dr. Hasell put me at ease on my first consultation. When it came time for my procedure the whole staff were very helpful and professional, and the I was very glad to have chosen Dr. Hasell. My procedure went flawlessly, and I could not have expected better results. A big thanks to Dr. Hasell, as well as Kelly Ann, Peggy, and Dawn, for making my surgery an enjoyable experience. Mary Looper"
"Broadway Family Physicians is an excellent medical practice. More specifically, Dr. Penelope Stalker is one of the most professional, knowledgeable, and caring medical practitioners that I have ever seen. Dr. Stalker's compassion for her patients is obvious and is thorough in identifying a proper diagnosis. I am generally very nervous about seeing physicians as I am not sure what they are going to say about my condition and how they will treat me, but Dr. Stalker put my mind at ease immediately. Her advice and treatment for my condition have been really helpful and I have been feeling much better. Thank you so much Dr. Stalker!"
"Dr. Robert Wolf is an exemplary medical professional in the cosmetic surgery field. He is very attentive and during my visit made me feel knowledgeable about the procedures I was to undergo. He was able to provide me with information in simple terms that allowed me to feel more at ease about the procedures. After the operation I was very impressed with his work, which is worth the cost several times over. I highly recommend him to anyone. "
"I cannot say enough about Dr. Greyvenstein and his practice. He is a truly caring and knowledgeable and takes the time to listen during my appointment. I never feel rushed. The front desk and staff is very courtesous and I am seen right away. I would highly recommend Dr. Greyvenstein."
"All Physicians office's should take notes from Broadway Family! The entire appointment evolution was effortless and stress free. First off the receptionist greeted me and my son with our first names. The waiting area had an ample amount of activities to keep my son busy while we waited and was noticeably clean. Total time in the waiting area was 10 minutes. When we were called back we Dr. Penelope Stalker met us at the waiting room door. Dr. Stalker is a professional in all aspects. She put me and my son at ease the second she open the door with her genuine smile. Unlike other physicians i have seen, she spoke to me instead of down to me and even took the time to explain to my child the importance of regular check ups. When it was time for booster shots, she reassured my son that even though he would feel a slight prick, it would not hurt and even took the time to explain why shots were so important. At the conclusion of our appointment we were escorted to the waiting area by Dr. Stalker, were we were promptly addressed by the receptionist and on our way. My entire experience at Broadway Family Physicians was pleasant and comforting. "
"I first learned of Dr. Backstein when I read his article about the pros and cons of liposuction. My first phone call to schedule my initial consultation was met by an understanding receptionist who immediately booked my appointment. At my first consultation with Dr. Backstein, he spent almost two hours with me going over my chart and my liposuction options including the overall risks and what he thought was the preferred choice of liposuction for me. He also spent time going over the prices, which was an important factor to me. Overall, my first impression of Dr. Backstein was very good. I came away informed of the risks, but felt comfortable that I was making the right choice of cosmetic surgeon. Dr. Backstein also met with me pre-operation to go over all of my questions and answered them fully. I was prepared for the procedure and knew I was in good hands. After the surgery and recovery was completed, Dr. Backstein visited with me to make sure that I was satisfied and followed up with me three months later to check on my status. Of course, the surgery was a success and I'm looking forward to every day now. Thank you Dr. Backstein!"
"Let me just say that I could not be more pleased with the work done by Dr. Backstein. I had breast implants done and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. Both Dr. Backstein and the staff were extremely helpful throughout the entire process. The results are exactly like I thought they would be. I would certainly reccommend him a friend. "
"This review is regarding a Botox procedure at lakeview medical. I had been considering botox injections for a few years. I decided to drop by one day because I live in the area and would pass by the location. I'd never had any kind of cosmetic procedure before so I was a little nervous going in how it would work. Dr. Nave made my experience very pleasant, however. She explained the procedure to me in plain english and didn't make me feel uncomfortable whatsoever. It was quick, it was painless, and I am looking forward to my next appointment. I saw the results right away. Forehead wrinkles no more! I'm so grateful to Dr. Nave for helping me through my first experience with botox. Before I had always regarded it as unpleasant and not worth the money, but now that I've experienced it for myself and it was worth it! "
"I have had issues with my nose since I was a teenager. As I aged, my insecurities grew to terrible heights. When I decided to actually do something, Dr. Davis was the name that I kept hearing about. My nerves were calmed immediately by a caring staff. The nurses and aides have always been extremely compassionate and considerate, polite and professional, but most of all, they were all very 'real' and easy to talk to and deal with. Dr. Davis is incredible. He explained my options after actually listening to my concerns. He thoroughly explained the procedure, and on the day of surgery, he arrived early to chat with me and calm my fears. My aftercare has been nothing short of amazing. The staff is always a pleasure, and Dr. Davis has seen me on each appointment, pre and post surgery. I would reccomend him to anybody who asked for my opinion."
"I would like to commend Dr Brent Howley and his staff for the great assistance they gave me on getting Botox treatment, Dr Howley and his staff are wonderful and answered all my concerns,since this was the first time that I was having Botox treatment, the procedure was very simple and only took about 30 minutes, the Dr and staff were very informative and kind. I love the way botox made me look and feel so much better about myself and will soon be going back for some dermal fillers. "

" Dr.Francois Lacombe has a great bedside manor and listens to all your complaints. He is very compassionate, knowledgeable and caring.

Appointments are scheduled in a timely manner and he keeps his appointments your wait is never long. I would recommend Dr Francois Lacombe to all my friends and relatives, he is a great doctor. "
"It has been such a fantastic relief to have Dr. Ernst Greyvenstein as my family's doctor. Whenever one must search for a new doctor there is always the sinking feeling that all the "good ones" have already been taken. My family and I stopped worrying once we found Dr. Greyvenstein. He has an excellent and kind bedside manner that immediately helped us relax. He really listens to our concerns and is attentive enough to know when we're feeling apprehensive about something. He is willing to take the extra time to get to know a person and their personality before diagnosing their symptoms. We have never had an appointment delayed, and he makes a point of never making anyone wait alone in a room for long. I can honestly say I look forward to going to the doctor now. I feel like I am being looked after. It's nice to feel as if someone is putting my needs and my health first, and their time and their money second. I recommend Dr. Greyvenstein to all my friends and family all the time."
"I visited Dr. Rafik Bechbache office on referal from a friend. I found the building to kept quite nicely and the office staff was very friendly and helpful with my insurance information. When the nurse came to get me she was quite pleasant and took my blood pressure with a bit of concern and said she would let the Dr, know it was a bit high. I did find the room a bit chilly but I didn't have to wait long to see the Doctor. When he arrived he aske me how I was and what I was being seen for and I gave him a brief description and background. We made some small talk about fishing and so forth and he asked my family background. I found this visit quite helpful and will be changing my family over to his practice. Thanks!!!"
"I actually do not know where to begin, doctor Bensimon helped me with a very hard situation. I had a car accident and I was badly injured, I was not to worry about my body because I knew those were not going to affect me too much but there were one in my face that was going to let a pretty ugly scar which I did not like. A friend told me about doctor Eric Bensimon, he told me these great things that I could not believe but once I met him I realized that my friend was not exaggerating, he was the most kind since the beginning, he explained me the whole proccess and calmed my nerves about the entire thing, actually he was very pacient because I asked him so many things and he took the time to answer me. Now after the surgery I look even better, no side effects or anything, it took me like two months for the surgery pain to disappear but I dont have to worry about an ugly scar on my face, doctro Bensimon selfdemanding excellence what proofed me that he is the best."
"Lakeside Medical Clinic has given me the best experience from beginning to end and continues to only impress me. As a full family practice they have covered everything from times when I've felt under the weather at a moments notice to my regular yearly health visits. Their website is one of the best and easy to navigate. I can make appointments online, or call in and be helped by one of their helpful staff. Dr Georgina Barnardo is my doctor and I can only say she is incredible. She promptly sees me when I get there for my appointment and calmly listens to anything I have to say, whether its my yearly check up or a special visit when I'm feeling sick. There is no sense of rush even though there are always other patients to see and she is very good at answering any amount of questions I have bout my health or results. She is the model doctor we all wish for when we walk into a doctors office, she is personable while being professional and her staff is kind as well. Dr. Barnardo is someone I would highy reccommend to all my friends and family because I know that whether they have an emergency, need ob-gyn visit or other common medical needs the doctor will take care of them in her practice. Im confident of that and hopefully you get to experience the calm I do when visiting her office."

Dr. Ayling is a doctor I do not dread going to see!"
"Dr. Joseph Longnecker is a wonderful physician. His office is very warm and inviting, alleviating any anxiety that some may endure when going visiting the dotor. Dr. Longnecker is very personable and truly cares about each and every patient. My family has been seeing him for years. He is great with the kids and they absolutley adore him."
"I went to the office of Doctor Healley on March 15 for my annual female checkup. I must say, I have never, ever felt so comfortable as i was with this doctor. From the moment he walked into the patient room and introduced himself i felt a calm feeling. He was very gentle and reassuring during my entire exam. In my opinion, all doctors need to have the same bedside manners as this guy! Absolutely amazing! I am keeping him as my doctor!"
"I cannot say enough about Dr. Longnecker and his staff! We were in the area visiting my in laws when our daughter came down with what we thought was a cold. After OTC medicines didn't help we found Dr. Longnecker through our insurance website. They not only got us in immediately, but once we arrived we weren't left in the waiting room because we were walk ins. The staff was very courteous and easily put my daughter and I at ease. Dr. Longnecker was quick to come in, spent some time questioning what had been going on, and actually included my daughter in the convo. He prescribed some medicines and even gave us trials so I was able to take my sick girl home right away. Once I got back out front his staff had actually found a pharmacy near my in laws and called in the prescription for me! So helpful when you've got a sick child. Although we don't live in the area, I so thankful to know if the need ever arises again that Dr. Longnecker is available!"
"I could not be happier with my visit to The Baywood Clinic. Years of fear kept me from even thinking about getting Botox done, but as the lines in my face became deeper, I knew it was a matter of saving my self-esteem. My consultation with Dr. John Keller really put me at ease; what a wonderful and patient professional! Even though he is certified as an Advanced Botox Injector, he was very honest about the procedure and my concerns; he warned me that pain really does vary from one person to the next and was up front about the side-effects that may (but rarely do) occur. I really appreciated this and in the end, asked him to do my treatments. I am so grateful to Dr. Keller; everything turned out beautifully and I am scheduled for another session in 7 months!"
"I took my kid to Doctor Russell Albak, and as you all know, this being my first time with this doctor made me on my toes. Luckily, very quickly I realized that this is a doctor that is very patient with his patients, no matter their age, and willing to listen to all the side effects you have, and will even go step by step with you through all his procedures. He is calm, very detail oriented, and is very easy to talk to. But, the best part is that my kid, who usually puts up a fit at any doctors office, actually enjoyed going to the doctor here. At first my son was reluctant to open up, but after a while he was happily talking away not even realizing that he already got his shot. Doctor Russell Albak is a fantastic doctor, and I will make sure to stay with this doctor for a long time."
"Let me start by saying that I was skeptical about having any kind of "work" done. I was afraid that it would be over the top and noticeable in a negative way, but I couldn't stand the thought of my extremely large nose dominating my wedding photos and the wedding was less than a year away. So, I took my doubts to Dr. Richard Davis after a recommendation by a close friend of mine. Dr. Davis took the time to explain exactly what changes he would make and how my nose would then work with the rest of my facial features instead of standing out. After hearing how reassuring and confident Dr. Davis was I decided to go ahead with the procedure and I'm so glad that I did. Dr. Davis did such an amazing job, I couldn't be happier and my wedding pictures prove it. I'm not one to brag on myself but I looked amazing that day. Dr. Davis didn't just improve my looks, he improved my self-image and my life."
"Doctor Ernst Greyvenstein is an amazing physician. He actually cares about his patients and tries his very best to help in every way he can. He listens very well and I would trust any advice he gives me. I am extremely happy with this doctor and refuse to see any other physician."
"Dr. Bechbache was great. I went in because I had a chest cold. It turned out that I had an upper respiratory infection. Dr Bechbache was able to easily diagnose and get me the proper medication. The doctor was friendly and warm. Didn't make me feel stupid, but was really glad I came in. So was I. I would definitely reccomend the doctor to anyone and everyone in the area."
"Dr. Viviers is one of the kindest doctors I have seen in a long time. I recently contracted mono, which at the time I had no idea what was wrong with me, but with in minutes he knew what was ailing me. I was so happy to find such a knowledgeable doctor not only in general, but right in my own backyard. Thanks again Dr. Vivers I owe you one."
"Dr. Karima Ali's in my opinion is one of the finest doctors in this professional. Her courteous, comprehensive and attentive approach to my medical needs have by far superceded the recommendation and the referral that I received from my colleague. Prior to my first visit with Dr. Ali I was a little dismayed in my success at finding a medical practitioner that came with an authentic and geniune bedside manner as well. Needless to say that I have found that and more in Dr. Ali. Not only is the Dr. one of the top professionals in this field,the innovative technology and exceptional customer service is par none. I highly recommend Dr. Ali for anyone in need of this specific medical support."
"Dr. Karima Ali is a kind, accommodating physician who considers the needs of her patients as her top priority. I remember that when I first visited her, I instantly felt important and special in her eyes despite the numerous patients left in the waiting room. I have visited her for many years. She frequently asks after my family even if they do not have an appointment scheduled for that day. Dr. Ali also is attentive even when I am not in the office. She made sure that my medications were not contraindicated when my pharmacist called to consult with her. She refers me to specialists whenever she feels it is completely necessary and only after a thorough work-up was completed. She also takes my fear of advanced testing such as CAT scans carefully into consideration and gives me short trials of prescription medication instead to treat my symptoms. I consider her a close family friend after all these years and I can tell that she also knows me well and appreciates my loyalty to her."
"Was always kind and understanding. We have been going to this doctor for many years and have always felt a warm environment. It's nice to be treated as a person and not just a number!"
"Penelope Stalker gave me a "Cadillac" experience. Not only was her staff friendly and knowledgeable, but I was seen by the doctor in a timely matter. I felt that she was effective and compassionate as well as an expert in her field. She made me extremely comforatable and I would recommend her to women and families. "
"I called to make an appointment with Dr. Luna to see him for my vericose veins and was able to get in within one week. After arriving, I was taken back to his examining room within 15 minutes. I only had to wait another 15 minutes for him to arrive in the room. Dr. Luna very clearly explained the process I would undergo and all of the alternatives. He told me what to expect before, during, and after and patiently answered my questions. I would definetly recommend Dr. Luna to anyone!"
"I recently visited with Dr. Fernando Luna for treatment of my varicose veins. I was very impressed with the office. The staff was friendly and made me feel at home during my procedure. Dr. Luna was prompt and professional. I am very pleased with the outcome of my procedure and have already recommended his services to several friends. "
"We are so thankful that we found Dr. Lurie as our family physician. He is wonderful with our children, and my partner and I feel comfortable with him as well. He is very knowledgeable, and was able to diagnose a chronic condition that several other doctors had missed previously. Great office, too - the staff is very friendly, the waiting area is good for families, and it is so convenient to have lab work and x-rays done in the same building. We could not be happier with Dr. Lurie."
"I got a breast augmentation and lift from Dr. Valnicek. They look great!!! The swelling has finally gone down and I'm very happy with the results. The doctor and his staff were very nice and the surgery went without a hitch. Highly recommended!!!!"
"To this day, I cannot thank Dr. Elhai enough for what he has given back to me. I had a severe cleft lip, which my family could not afford to fix through surgery. Thus, I would always find myself being picked on by other people during school. One time, the bullies were particularly mean and they decided that my face was apparently not ugly enough because they proceeded to pummel my face to a bloody pulp. Following weeks of emergency room recovery, my nose was contorted out of position due to it being fractured and both of my cheeks were misshaped due to their multiple fractures. The doctors in Whales said that there was nothing that they could possibly do due to the degree of damage done to my face. Needless to say, I was mortified; I didn't want my face to attract any more negative attention. "
"Well I had a deviated septum that was causing some sleeping problems (apnea) and was referred to Dr. Valnicek from an Ear, Nose, and Throat Specialist as being the best in British Columbia. Immediately felt comfortable with the Dr. Valnicek as he told me exactly what the procedure involved and answered any doubts I had. The surgery was done within a couple of weeks and ran smoothly like I had expected. He made sure every step of the way was comfortable and rehab was a breeze under his direct care. It was my first time getting surgery of any kind and the doctor made all my doubts go away with his care."
"I am not one to normally write a review. But I want to let you know about Dr. Rafik Bechbache, my families truly gifted doctor. As our family physician he has gone out of his way to provide superior service, he has been available at all times of the day and night, and has accurately diagnosed and treated our families' sicknesses and illnesses for the time we have known him. Supported by the quality staff at Markham Stouffville Hospital I don't know what we did before he was our doctor. He has certainly improved my life and the lives of my family. Thanks Doctor Bechbache. "
"Dr. Backstein was wonderful. He was friendly and helpful walking me through my procedure and his level of professionalism was very comforting. I would highly recommend him."
"I need to have some cosmetic Surgery done, however hearing horror stories I was a bit nervous. I went into Dr. Forrest's office and all of my nervousness was put at ease. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean, and Dr. Chris (as I like to call him) was very detailed; he went over everything with me. I recommend this place to anyone looking for an excellent Surgeon. I will be going back also I have referred my 2 best friends and a co-worker; they all have rave reviews."
"Dr. Bechbache has been our family physician for several years now. I wouldn't take my family to anyone else if I didn't have to. Dr. Bechbache genuinely listens to your complaints and makes you feel like you and your health really matter to him."
"I'll be honest, when I was first looking for doctors for cosmetic surgery i was a bit nervous. I have always wanted to have a breast enlargement. I thought that they would judge and laugh at me. I was also worried about the cost. But one day while talking to a coworker of mine about cosmetic surgery, she told me that she knew a friend who knows a surgeon who she swears by. I was a little reluctant when I made the appointment call and first talked to the receptionist. As I kept talking to her and asking her questions I felt more and more comfortable with this office. So then I scheduled an appointment for the next day and went into the office. I was called in the room almost immediately and then met Dr. Luna. He was the nicest person I have ever met in my life, no joke. He was so easy to talk to and answered all my silly questions and calmed my worries. We also discussed payment options that lets me make low monthly payments that I can afford. And then let me tell you, the surgery was a big success! I look fabulous and would have gone through this whole experience again. I would like to give a BIG thanks to Dr. Luna and Lola (the receptionist) for all their help. I would recommend Dr. Luna to anyone who wants or is even considering cosmetic surgery. He is THE best!"
"Dr. Desmond Van Jaarsveldt provides and excellent experience for my wife and I when visiting the office. We have been able to come in for office visits even when we were unable to make an appointment! The staff is very fast and friendly. -Mr. Tom Jones"
""Experience Matters" is how I would describe my results overall in completing a face lift through the office of Doctor Howard Silverman of Ottawa. I did a lot of reading and research in making my decision to take the risk of having a face lift. Once I decided that I would have the procedure done, I had to do a good deal more research in selecting a doctor and practice to perform my surgery. It is true that your results ARE only as good as the skill that the doctor has in performing the surgery itself. I carefully reviewed Dr. Silverman's qualifications and references, I read his patient referrals, spoke with past patients and looked at his before and after results. I also took into account the number of years he has been performing surgeries and the number of face lift procedures he has performed. After considering all this information, the decision for me to use Dr. Howard Silverman to perform my surgery was easy. I am very pleased with my results. The after care I received following the surgery was excellent and helped make my results the best they could be. "
"The Family Health Team at Niagra-on-the-Lake has been a blessing to our family for the past four years. We are particularly indebted to Dr. Francios Viviers, who has become our family's physician. We are grateful for the attentiveness given to our family by the FHT, and for their compassion and professionalism. Dr. Viviers has dedicated himself to his patients, and we have become very confident in his skills and capabilities when treating our family. He is particularly compassionate and bears a gentle bedside manner, which is so appreciated, yet seldom seen in today's busy times. The staff of the FHT is professional, courteous and also very caring. They are clearly well-trained, yet they bring a quality of personal, individual care to the patient in a stressful situation. We are very grateful to Dr. Viviers and his team. "
"Doctor Eric Bensimon might be my favorite doctor ive been to. I saw him after i hurt my wrist and he quickly figured out that it was just sprained and not broken. He perscribed some pain pills and a 2 week session of therapy for it. My wrist now feels perfect. He was also very nice and curtious person. I would highly reccomend him. "
"I just wanted to say that Dr.Joseph Longnecker is one of the best doctors I have ever seen. I live in Fullerton, California and my child was very sick. I took him to many doctors and none of them knew the problem. I was searching for some doctors near me when I saw his name. I called him and he told me he would see my child right away. He is affiliated with St Jude Medical Center which is in Fullerton, California. He checked my child for about ten minutes and instantly knew what was wrong with him. He gave me a prescription for some medicine and another appointment so he could check up on my child again. He was very helpful and did not give me an appointment that was months away. I would recommend Dr.Joseph Longnecker to everyone I know. He is truly a very good doctor."
"When my wife and I found at that she was pregnant we decided to visit Dr. Francois Lacombe. We went based on other reviews we had read and we were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and we were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable we were with Dr. Lacombe. He delivered our son and everything went wonderfully throughout the entire pregnancy and delivery. We were treated respectfully and the entire staff gave us support and understanding at all times. At one visit Dr. Lacombe even waived his normal $20 fee for us being late to the appointment! We will definitely be using his services again for our next pregnancy and my wife will continue to see him for her obstetric and family practice needs. We would highly recommend Francois Lacombe to anyone looking for a new Doctor."
"The visit was wonderful. Stuff that were assign the day I went were very accessible. Polite and respect were given at all steps of the process. I would recommend it to my friends. The sense of belonging was indeed met."
"I went to Dr. Rafik for a routine checkup for my whole family. He and his staff were very professional and they made our family feel comfortable with the care we received. I would recommend him to any family."
"My name is Samantha. I needed to get laser hair removal done on my upper lip and the back of my head. I have heard good reviews about the Epiderma online clinic so I decided to look into it. I made an appointment with Doctor Fernando Luna, went in and despite the fact that I've been going to doctors for most of my life, I was still a little nervous. He was able to keep me calm, explain the full procedure and how long the procedure lasts. Needless to say, it was a hassle free and pain free experience. I would highly recommend going to this clinic for any various cosmetic needs you would need. They have excellent service as well as excellent doctors. Thank you."
"I went to Dr. Grant Ayling today for the first time. I had just moved to the area and a friend mentioned him and I decided to give it a chance. I was so surprised how nice they are there. He was very attentive when I described my symptoms. And I would recommend people to see Dr Grant Ayling before anyone else. "
"I had acquired this horrible cough that lasted over a month. I had tried all of the OTC medicine that was available. I thought my cough was getting better until one night when I couldn't breathe well. I saw an ad for Lakeside Medical Clinic the day before and saw that they accepted walk-in's. I rushed over there and received a fast response to my problem. Doctor Barnardo was assigned to me and quickly did the required tests to diagnose my condition. Dr. Barnardo was very polite and skilled at what she was doing. Let's just say that I stopped coughing and have never felt better!"
"Dr Russell Albak was great when we had to bring our young son Joshua in because he'd tripped going down the stairs to the basement. Fortunately he didn't land on his head, but it turned out that he had managed to get a concussion anyway, and Dr. Albak was able to tell from how he was acting. He checked out both his legs and his arms too, and Joshua had a sprain so his arm will have to be in a sling for a week or so. Normally when we see Dr. Albak Joshua gets a big lollypop, but because of the concussion he can't have one today but when he comes in next week for a follow-up Dr. Albak said he could have two, and Joshua is excited for that."
"I saw Dr. Hasell last fall when he helped me with the repair of some skin on my hand that had been burned due to an accident at work. He was very thorough in answering questions proactively during the initial consultations, and also afterward about post-op care and so forth. I feel he takes his the quality of his work very seriously and therefore I trusted him to do a great job, and he did!"
"I have been a patient of Dr Healley for over 6 years and I have always found him to be an excellent physician. He has an in depth knowledge of my particular medical condition and has treated it very successfully during the time I have been a patient. I can't recommend Dr Heally highly enough. "
"Doctor Francois Lacombe practices family medicine and specializes in obstetrics. While he does practice family medicine, he only accepts new pregnancy patients now. Very experienced, he has delivered more than 5,000 babies! Try and make your initial appointment two to four months in advance, but if that is not possible you can make an urgent appointment through his secretary. He practices out of Polyclinic Medical Concorde and has around 2,000 patients. Since he practices with six other doctors, a physician is always available when you need one. "
"Johann Kriegler is by far one of the best doctors that I've ever had. I have never been so comfortable paying a visit to a doctor in my life. Everything Dr. Johann does just seems right and natural. I definitely recommend Dr. Johann for anyone who is looking for a kind and caring doctor."
"John Keller is well-like by many, and has an extraordinary amount of skill. Dr. Keller uses more natural approaches to surgery, with amazing results. With reasonable prices and a kind, caring environment, this is simply the best clinic for cosmetic surgery of any kind. Dr. Keller is an experienced and successful individual. "
"Dr. Douglas A. Taranow should be near the top of anyone's list who is looking to have a cosmetic procedure performed. With his extensive background in general surgery and specialization treating burn victims Dr. Taranow has now made a reputation as one of NY's top plastic surgeons. I was amazed how little scarring was present after my procedure. Dr. Taranow seemed to really understand my process of healing after the procedure and kept me as comfortable and informed as possible at every step along the way. Definetely would recommend him to my friends and family!!"
"Dr. Macadam is a very good doctor. First off, the wait time to be seen is very short--around 5-10 minutes. The receptionists at the front are very friendly. They make filling out the initial paperwork very easy and are very willing to help you if you have questions. The nurses are also very helpful. They seem very knowledgeable and make you feel at ease. The facilities are also very clean. The equipment is brand new and state of the art. Dr. Macadam is a very kind doctor--she is very good at listening when you tell her your concerns. She is very detail oriented and thorough. After the surgery, she follows up with you personally and makes sure everything is ok. I had a few concerns and when she saw me, I was reassured that there was not anything to be concerned about."
"I have one word for Dr. LeBlanc; AMAZING! He is extremely professional, very competent, and has great interpersonal skills. He explained all the pros and cons associated with my procedure so that I could make an informed decision. My procedure was a huge success and I was very pleased with Dr. LeBlanc follow up care!! He is the best!"
"Several months ago I was in search of a Doctor to tell me why I had several spots on my skin. I was recommended to Doctor Johann Kriegler by a friend. I made a Doctor's appointment to see Dr. Kriegler on the next available date that I could be seen. My visit to his office was very cordial. He showed compassion to me by being engage through the entire visit. He is a professional and is excellent at his job. He recommended a treatment for my spots and over the period time I applied what He recommended and whatever was trying to takeover my skin went away. I recommend you visit Mediclinic Family Medicine and Urgent Care,101-3333-8th Street East,Saskatoon, Sask.S7H 4K1. "
"Mr Richard Davis is everything that modern doctors lack. His bedside manner is top notch. He took the time to explain all of my options to me in a way I couldn't understand. I got the impression he was talking to me,not at me,as some medical professionals do. He was very warm and kind after the procedure. He fully explained to me what was going to happen during and after the surgery,and made sure i was 100% comfortable and ready for the next stage. Mr Davis also called the next morning to make sure I was not experiencing anything out of the ordinary,and told me to call his office if anything changed with my recovery. During my follow up visit,he was very patient with my questions and concerns. He made me feel that if there was every a problem or issue,that his office was available to me. I also got a postcard in the mail a week after thanking me for my business,along with a nice card. I would recommend Dr Davis to anyone else looking for a quality doctor that will take his time to make sure your comfortable with the process from begining to end. "
"I had been searching for a great surgeon for some time now. I have always had that "beer gut." When I first contacted the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, I was greeted by one of the nicest women I had ever talked to. She made it easy for me to set up a consultation and I was in within the next few weeks. I was paired with doctor Martin Jugenburg. Wow! I was so excited when I met him and I felt extremely comfortable and at ease with him. My biggest concern was about safety and I told this to Dr. Jugenburg. He assured me that he was very experienced and has been doing this for a long time. Once before I had gone to a different clinic and had a consultation but decided against it after the doctor was very rude to me and the cost was out of my price range. When I talked with Dr. Jugenburg, I felt like I was chatting with an old friend. And when I heard the price, I was shocked! The price was fair and a lot less than anywhere in the surrounding area! I decided to get a tummy tuck and was set up with an appointment. I'm not going to lie; it takes some time to recover and you will be sore. However, I am extremely satisfied with my results and that "beer gut" is no more! I appreciated all of the help and kindness that Dr. Jugenburg and his staff have given me. I go back for a checkup in about two weeks and I cannot wait until I am able to go swimming and not think about if other people are staring at my stomach. I can't wait! "
"Dr. Mohammed M. Elahi is a great cosmetic surgeon. I couldn't be happier with the work he did. Not only does he do great work, he also has a great personality and gave me the feeling that he actually cared about the end results, and not just getting my money. My decision to have cosmetic surgery wasn't an easy one to make, and once I decided to go ahead with it, I wanted to make sure I found the right Dr. Other doctors I visited just treated me like a number and didn't make me feel very comfortable. Dr. Elahi was different - he took his time with me and explained all the details of the procedure and took the time to answer my questions. I would recommend Dr. Elahi to anyone considering cosmetic surgery. "
"During a recent visit to the Family Practice run by Susan Hunter of the St. Joseph's General Hospital, I was genuinely surprised by the staff. They went to great lenghts to ensure me and my child were comfortable during what at the time felt like a scary situation. Everyone took the time to explain what was happening, why and made sure my son was comfortable. Needless to say I think her and her staff are top notch and will not be taking my son anywhere else!"
"I had been unhappy with the texture of my facial skin for a couple of years. I also was self-conscious about some uneven pigmentation and spotting that I had developed from sun exposure over the years. I am in my 40s and in great shape, my face just looked older than I felt. I found Dr. Robinson through the American Board of Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. My primary care physician had told me the most important thing to look for when searching for a plastic surgeon is to make certain they are Board Certified in plastic surgery. I was very nervous when I went to my appointment, but Dr. Robinson quickly put me at ease once he came into the exam room. He looked at the areas on my face that bothered me and suggested a Laser Skin Resurfacing treatment, which he would be able to perform in his office. We discussed what the procedure would entail, and also what recovery would be like and what results I could realistically expect. I agreed that this course of treatment would best suit my needs and then met with the office manager to make my appointment and go over payment options. I returned a week later for my Laser Skin Resurfacing and the procedure was a bit uncomfortable, but not at all painful. I received numbing injections before the treatment and honestly that was the worst part. During the recovery period, I made certain to follow all of the post-procedure instructions exactly and at 10 weeks post-procedure, I am so pleased with my results. My skin is smoother, brighter and has an overall fresh look. I am very satisfied with the care I received from Dr. Robinson and plan to return to him in a few weeks to discuss facial filler injections. "
"Dr. Cynthia Nave at Lakeview Medical Clinic is an outstanding listener. She really takes the time to hear your concerns and answer any questions you may have. She is very easy to talk to and she makes the time to cover everything you want or need to know. Her professionalism is beyond reproach and she will help calm any fears you may have."
"Ted Jablonski brings the phrase, 'More Than Medication,' to a bright light. His practice allows patients to bring forward their individual and specific needs, while he provides his vast knowledge to provide a holistic approach of healing and success. Dr. Jablonski is not your average doctor whom went to school for years for specified qualifications and became a doctor. He works in Nursing Homes while he is also trained in Sexual Health. He continues his education, while educating others throughout Canada. I give my highest acceptance and appreciation for Dr. Ted Jablonski's practice, as I have been given the most quality care and feel that I am actually being cared for while in his presence. "
"Before Doctor Richard Davis, I was in trouble. I had a deviated septum that not only made it hard to breathe, but hard to sleep. It seemed like every few minutes my mind would be taken away from whatever I was doing and I actually had to concentrate on breathing. For a long time I actually thought this was normal! But that was before I met Dr. Davis. His scheduling staff was thoughtful and nice, and the Doctor himself very professional. I wasn't just a paycheck to him, but a patient. He talked to me for almost an hour about the concerns I had to fix my problem, and just generally made me feel very comfortable. The surgery went great, and now I can breathe again! Thank you Doctor Davis."
"I visited Dr Mazza-Whelan's office for advice on nutrition. I'd heard she and her staff we friendly and very knowledgeable in regards to their services. Dr Mazza-Whelan was extremely patient with my questions, and made me feel comfortable. Her answers were clear and precise, and I know I can trust her for my family and my future visits."
"I went to see Dr. Albak for the first time today after researching their website. I was checked in promptly and taken back to an exam room within just a few minutes where my vital signs were taken. After a short wait, the Dr. came in, washed his hands, shook my hand and welcomed me to their practice. He listened attentively while I described my symptoms while taking notes on his laptop. He asked me a few questions then examined me and discussed treatment in laymen's terms I could understand. I was very impressed with Dr. Albak's courtesty and professionalism, and believe I have finally found a doctor who really cares about my health. There is a LOT of information on their website, including contact numbers, hours, and all of the services their clinic offers. Two thumbs up...I highly recommend Dr. Albak! "
"Dr. Mazza-Whelan is an absolutely wonderful doctor. I had come in for some sudden headaches which would not go away for several days; as soon as the nurse came to check my vitals and submitted the chart to the doc, she came in right away and asked me more details about my headache. The doctor spent a great deal of time with me and was very courteous even when a nurse interrupted. my problem was resolved when the doc provided me some light counseling; she gave me a referral to see a neurologist if I feel the same pains again. I really admire her holistic approach and that she didn't just prescribe me a medication. Thank you doc!"
"When I visited doctor Franklin, he was nothing but helpful and patient with me when we were picking out the options for my surgery. I would recommend him to anyone! My recovery time afterwards was shorter than ever, and if I ever need more procedures I would come back to him in a heartbeat."
"Dr. Desmond VanJaarsveldt has been a valued member of this medical community for many years. I have trusted him to provide medical care for my entire family, from the youngest child to my elderly parents. He is always professional and courteous and he never seems to mind taking the extra time to explain something I don't understand. He will make house calls if we are too sick to drive to the office but if we are at the office, he makes sure to remind us that the pharmacy which is part of their practice can fill our prescriptions quickly. I like that we don't have to drive all over town to have it filled. One other good point about this doctor and Four Rivers Medical practice is that they have extended hours, starting very early in the morning until late in the evening; in addition, they have a walk-in clinic for emergencies. I don't think I would trust a new graduate doctor with the health of my family anywhere near as much as I trust Dr. Van Jaarsveldt. He makes us feel as though he truly cares about us."
"I had been suffering from wrinkles and sag lines on my face for a few years and have been self conscious about it since i got them. Finally, I had decided to see a doctor. I was referred to Dr. John Keller at Baywood Clinic by a friend and decided to check him out myself. When I went to see him the extremely friendly receptionist helped me fill out my paperwork and I was in the office with the doctor within 10 minutes. Dr. Keller listened to everything I had said with true interest. He seemed to really care about everything i had to say. We discussed my options and ended up choosing skin filler and botox. I went back 2 weeks later and had both operations done at the same time. My face looked exactly as it did when I was in my twenties. Dr. Keller did an unbelievable job and I recommend him to anyone looking for cosmetic surgery."
"Doctor Sheina Macadam was the best surgeon i have ever seen in my long life! The best in her profession. The medical procedure went flawlessly. I was given an excursion into to the complex surgery before hand. "
"Dr. Cynthia Nave is one of the best doctors I have been to for my botox injections. Other doctors are too rough and do not take time to get to know their patients. Dr. Nave always takes the time during each appointment to ask you about yourself, and what brought you to her office. She also takes the time to learn something about your personal life, in order to ensure that she is providing you with all of the services that you need or didn't realize you needed. I will definitely be returning to Dr. Nave's office in the future, and I will definitely recommend her as well as her practice to all of my friends!"
"Dr. Franklin Richards recently performed liposuction surgery on me. I am very satisfied with the results of my surgery and the services he provided. You can barely see the small incisions that were made and can definitely see the slimming results! I would highly recommend Dr. Richards and his entire staff. I felt very well taken care of during my consultation, procedure and follow-ups."
"I visited Dr. Sheina Macadam to see what my options were following a rather massive weight loss. I was happy to be so much thinner but my main goal, to be able to show off my new body, was impossible with all of the loose skin. Dr. Macadam assured me that abdominoplasty could solve my problem. Fast forward a month and I am very pleased with the results. It took me a week or so to get back to my normal routine but I think the results will allow me to actually visit the beach this year without a shirt on. I haven't done that since high school so it will be a huge life change for me. I am pleased with the results. I also want to throw in a little extra credit for Dr. Macadam's personal skills. She made me feel at ease from the very beginning and this pleasant "bedside manner" helped me get through the process with some confidence."
"Dr. Eric Bensimon is a very accomplished plastic surgeon. He is on the staff of Sacre-Coeur Hospital and he teaches at the University of Montreal, plastic surgery department. He has worked with Drs. Menard and Brassard since 2002, performing facial feminization surgery as well as plastic surgery and craniofacial surgery. He is an excellent doctor and has a wonderful bedside manner. I am very pleased with his work and would recommend him to anyone. He takes the time to listen to what your needs and concerns are."
"My experience with Dr. John Keller was unmatched!! From the time that I entered the office until my treatment was complete, I received the most amazing customer service. Although this was my first experience, Dr. Keller as well as his staff made me feel very comfortable about my procedure, and his medical expertise was enlightening. When you leave his office you will not be nervous if you were before, and you will understand everything that will happen during your procedure. I highly recommend him after this experience."
"Dr. Wolf is one of the most personable and thorough cosmetic surgeons I have hadthe pleasure of meeting and working with. In light of all the misconceptions about cosmetic surgeons, he is a welcome respite for patients who are not sure if they even need anything done. He lessens their fears and explains every option available to them. This practice as well has a very comforting feel so that even in the waiting room potential patients can relax and take a deep breath. Cosmetic surgery can make people nervous to contemplate but a place like Dr. Wolf's office is a place to relax and approach things calmly (which is a good change!). Were I to consider a cosmetic surgeon I would gladly see Dr. Wolf."
"Went to Dr Richards office for a consultation and information on breast implant surgery. Was very nervous and unsure but within minutes the staff made me feel right at home and at ease. Dr Richards was great as he explained the procedure to me, answering all my question and addressing all of my concerns. Long story short I had my breast surgery and couldn't be more pleased ! Dr Richard did an outstanding job ! I was worried my breasts would look unnatural but they don't and actually it looks like I was born with " them " :) Thank you Dr Richards !!"
"I have been going to Dr. Nave for many years now. She is the best family doctor I have ever had. She really takes the time to listen to my concerns and make a proper diagnosis. She is not afraid to ask for a consult if she needs one. Her office is always busy but the staff there are very professional and wait times are short. There is no gossip among the staff members and I've only ever heard them say nice things about Dr. Nave. She answered all my questions about the Botox procedure I was considering and yet I didn't feel pressured to do it in any way. She helped me make an informed decision about what was right for me. I truly felt like she cared about me as a person and didn't just see me as a dollar sign. Very clean facility too!"
"Dr. Davis did an amazing job on my rhinoplasty surgery. I came from Georgia and his website helped me with information on South Florida and how to find his office. I was very impressed at his lengthy credentials and that is why I chose him in the first place. Very good visit"
"Dr. Silverman and his staff were very friendly and professional through my transformation process. They took their time to explain, in detail what I would expect during each step of the procedure, including pre and post treatment. I am very satisfied with the outcome of Dr. Silvermans work and with my overall experience with the office visits. "
"The doctors office provides excellent service with highly qualified physicians who are coherent when expressing what their patients should do for their well being."
"My experience with Dr. Wasserfall was absolutely fabulous. His demeanor and attitude were caring and helpful. He had a humor about him which helped ease any tension my family had about going to the doctor. Our youngest daughter had to get some vaccines and we were expecting a lot of tears, but Dr. Wasserfall was able to talk her through it (with the help of my wife and I, of course) and we left the office with tear-free MMR shots. I would recommend Dr. Wasserfall to ANYBODY!"
"I liked that I was able to see Dr. Ayling the same day. It's comforting to be seen by your own doctor the day you need them. I was having pain in my stomach and wasn't sure what to do. Dr. Ayling was so good with me and I felt that he was really listening to me. He never jumped in to try to talk over me - I hate that. The examination was thorough but quick. Then he had several ideas on how I could feel better. I really appreciated that he did not just tell me it would just go away or just give me a pill. We discussed the method I felt most comfortable with and then he explained what to do if that wasn't enough. He was great and told me what to do if I needed more urgent help during off-clinic hours. When I left Dr. Ayling's clinic, I felt relieved and like I had a plan. Thank you so much Dr. Ayling! "
"Over the last few years I became aware of excess skin and fat accumulation above my eyelids. I felt awkward at times feeling that others were not looking directly at me but instead my eyelids. One of my friends recommended that I visit Doctor Sheina Macadam. My friend confided in me that she had cosmetic surgery performed for the exact same issue a couple of years earlier and was very happy with the results. So following her recommendation I made an appointment to see Doctor Macadam. Initially I felt awkward and unsure talking about cosmetic surgery. Doctor Macadam was very open, friendly and patient in explaining what she could offer to help. She didn't rush the consultation and explained what my options were. I decided to have a blepharoplasty (the medical term for the procedure to reduce unwanted fat and skin hanging above the eyelids) performed. I was fully informed before the operation what to expect immediately after the surgery was completed. My surgery lasted only a couple of hours and I was able to return home the same day. I had no complications or surprises. Thanks to the skills of Doctor Sheina Macadam and her professional staff, my eyelids now look like I used to when I was younger. I no longer feel awkward about how I look and feel. I would recommend Doctor Sheina Macadam to anyone who wishes to look and feel better about themselves."
"Martin Jugenburg from Toronto Cosmetic Surgery was fantastic. I am a 63 year old woman, I had flabby arms. Dr. Jugenburg was helpful in helping me make the decision to have an Arm Lift. I am so pleased with the results. I can now wear tank tops and short sleeve shirts without being self conscious. Thanks Dr. Jugenburg. "
"I went to this doctor about one month ago for a face lift. I am 45 years old, and the wrinkles on my face look absolutely horrible. After only 4 days of prep, the surgery was only 1.5 hours long, and extremely easy to undergo, no pain. The results were absolutely astonishing! I look about 15 years younger, and I am a lot more confident and happy with my life. Would definitely recommend Dr. Brassard!"
"I have been seeing my doctor Ted Jablonski for a little over a year now, and I enjoy my appointment times. I always can get in to see him in a timely matter, he ansewrs all of my questions, and always asks me my opinion on new medications, or certain treatments. I feel like a real person and not just a number with him. I appreciate the fact that he knows i know my body. He's a great doctor, i reccommend him to anyone, and i will continue with him as well."
"Having spent most of my adolescent years completely covered from head to toe regardless of the season, weather or temperature, I am so relieved to finally look in the mirror and see me - and not the ugly scars left behind by acne. Dr. Robinson and the entire office staff have truly given me back a freedom I have not experienced since before I was a teenager. What an amazing feeling to walk out of the house, confident I look my best because I feel my best. No more excruciating hours in the mirror trying to "cover-up". No more shopping for just the right clothing to conceal the acne damage. I can't begin to express how grateful I am for Dr. Robinson's talents. Thank you, thank you, thank you! You have changed my life. I want to share my story with others in hopes that they too can experience the new opportunities your treatment has offered me."
"John Hasell five star review. I went in to see DR John Hasell, I have never seen him befor today and how impressed was I when I walked in to his office. I have heard good things about DR John Hasell and also have heard that he sees people for cosmetic surgery, we wont go in to detail on what I had to see DR John Hasell for but what a great doctor to see. The staff was very friendly and helpful, I got right in to see the doctor even being a new patient there, to my amazement he was able to answer all of my questions he did not rush me out the door to get the next paying patient in there, he treated me like I was the only one that he was going to see that day even though he had a lobby full of patients. I left knowing all the answers to my questions and was very satisfied."
"Recently I had to switch doctors as I was not happy with my doctor as I had been ill for several months and they had no solution and could not come up with a proper diagnosis. I came across Doctor Viviers at Niagara on the Lake family health and him and the entire staff were truly a blessing. Because of them I am finally better because they were thorough and continued to follow up with me until a proper diagnosis was made. Unlike many other doctors he is not just out to make a buck, I feel he does truly care about his patients. Doctor Viviers is very friendly and makes you feel comfortable and you can trust he has your best interest in mind. I can again trust a Doctor thanks to Doctor Viviers and the rest of the staff at Niagara on the lake. Not only do you get the great service of Doctor Viviers there are 9 other physicians on staff who cover for each other and they all seem to duplicate the efforts of Doctor Viviers. I would recommend Doctor Viviers and the entire Niagara on the lake practice to other family members and friends. Your health is an important part of your life and I think its important to find a practice that believes this as well and I have found this in Niagara on the lake."
" Due to many years of being on my feet I started getting vericose veins in my calves. At first they were just unsightly but after awhile I developed complications and my legs started swelling. I contacted The Epiderma clinic and met with Dr. Fernando Luna. He made me feel completely comfortable and was very knowledgeable about my condition. It is more common than I realized. We set up an appointment for an ultrasound so he could diagnose the extent of the probelm. Dr. Fernando Luna communicated with me every step of the way and talked to me in a way I could understand. On the day of the surgery Dr. Fernando Luna and his staff took great care of me. My legs look 20 years younger thanks to Dr. Fernando Luna! I couldn't be happier!"
"I had been considering botox treatment for a while. A friend recommended Dr. Keller at The Baywood Clinic and I couldn't be happier with my experience! Dr. Keller and the staff were incredibly helpful, courteous and professional. The results were fantastic and the price can't be beat. I would highly recommend Dr. Keller for regular treatments, or just for a special occasion."
"I saw Dr. Hunter in December of last year for a case of Pnuemonia, she did a wonderful job of listening to me explain to her that I always get Pnuemonia every year and she suggested that I get the Pnuemonia shot to keep this from reoccurring. She has been the first doctor to really listen to me, and answered my questions with no problems, she really took her time with me. She's been a great doctor for me. Highly recommend!"
"Dr. Penelope Stalker, of Broadway Family Physicians, is a joy to work with. She was my doctor for an recent annual physical and did a great job. While being not only through, she asked many questions and answered many from me. She never seemed in a hurry to finish and her personality was made the experience as good as it could be. I would recommend Dr. Stalker without question."
"Dr Andre Aboolian is a truly amazing doctor who places the needs and well being of his patients first. Dr Aboolian offers heartfelt advice and encouragement throughout the consultation, procedure, and during recovery. The result of my surgery are amazing and I have referred several friends who all have nothing but positive things to say. He truly values his work and his patients privacy and confidentiality. I truly recommend Dr Andre Aboolian to anyone considering a cosmetic procedure."
"I went to Dr Grants practice because i was experiencing chest pains. I was extremely pleased with how quickly i was able to see the Doctor. The practice while located on third floor was easy to find. Dr Grant was very polite and gentle, he was prompt and quick with his diagnosis. As it turns out i was suffering from a minor condition, none the less the doctor set me at ease. I would recommend the Doctors practice to my friends and family. "
"Christopher Forrest is possibly one of the best physicians I have ever met! His care for his patients could only be outdone by his incredible personality. I look foward to return to his care in the future."
"After the birth of my third child, my body seemed to have a harder time bouncing back. When I finally decided on liposuction for my "muffin top", I visited a few different practices in the area. Dr. Richards and the staff at Cosmetic Surgery Associates, PA made me feel welcome and comfortable from the moment I walked through the door. Dr. Richards was both knowledgeable and understanding. He made me feel at ease and confident in this decision. As for the procedure, it went better than I could have ever hoped. There are no scars that I can see, and my sides and back are slimmer and more attractive than ever! I feel like a new woman, and it's all thanks to this amazing doctor! "
"i have been a patient with Dr. Russell Albak for 15 years now. I am thankful to have found such a caring family physican. He delivered both of my children and continues to care for them in their teens. The hours are convinent. The open clinic hours are so convient. My youngest child was diagnoised with diabetes. we have gotten state of the art treatment for him. There is a nutritionist that Dr Russell Albak set us up with. MAking a difficult condition manageable. he got my little boy a special book to expalin diabetes to him. It is extremely important that they have onsite labs. Dr Russell Albak was kind of enough to instruct that I needed a butterfly ne edle when I get my blood drawn because my vein rolled. It cured a life long fear of needles. Dr. Russell Albak takes the time to talk to me not at me. "
"Dr. Ali is my favorite doctor of all time. I had felt that I'd never get the care that I wanted or felt I deserved until I went to her. She listens very carefully and actually takes all of your symptoms and/or concerns into consideration instead of just focusing on one thing and not treating the other conditions or looking into other possibilities. It's refreshing to find a medical professional who actually cares. Finally, someone who truly knows what health CARE is. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for more personalized attention."
"My husband and I have been patients of Dr. Van Jaarsveldt for years. We received good, thorough care. More importantly, we have never had to wait for more than fifteen minutes to be seen. The doctor is prompt. The long wait-time was the reason we left our previous clinic. The nurses here are friendly, and overall we are very pleased with the care we receive."
"Rafik Bechbache is the definition of an outstanding family physician. I have referred several patients to him because of his keen and adept skills in the medical field. He will be able to answer any question, about anything medical related. The great thing is, that he is also available to non-English speakers, more specifically French speakers. He is a very understanding physician and takes his time to fully analyze each and every patient. I would recommend Dr. Bechbache in a heartbeat to anyone. "
"I recently saw Dr. Robert Backstein to get cosmetic reconstructive surgery on my nose, as I had recently been in a terrible car accident. Dr. Backstein and his staff were very accommodating and friendly, and were there every step of the way to help me through my surgery and my recovery process. At first I was nervous about getting surgery, but after speaking with Dr. Backstein all of my fears were alleviated. The doctor was very knowledgeable and was able to answer any questions I had in a professional manner. I would recommend this practice to my friends and family anytime. For more information go to the website www.cosmeticsurgerytoronto.com, there you will find contact information for the wonderful staff and I am confident they respond to and questions or concerns promptly. "
"I have been a patient of Dr. Rafik Bechbache for the past three years. I am very pleased with the service that I receive. The waiting time is very minimal. Dr. Bechbache takes the time that I need to completely answer all of my questions to the fullest extent possible and also gives other suggestions that will help me in my personal health goals. I was referred to Dr. Bechbache from a friend and I am very happy being a patient of Dr. Bechbache's family practice clinic. The staff is very friendly and the doctor is very well versed in family practice issues. I would recommend Dr. Bechbache to all my friends and family and also share with them how pleased I am to be a patient of Dr. Bechbache's clinic."
"Franklin Richards is an amazing doctor that I have never had any problems with whatsoever. He is very trustworthy, and doesn't overcharge you for his practices like many other doctors. He is very caring and understanding when it comes to personal problems. He is by far the best cosmetic doctor I have ever had, and I would never choose another doctor over him. "
"I had just moved to Calgary and I realized after I was done unpacking that there was something wrong with my ear. I didn't know anyone in the area so I chose Dr. Healley because his office was the most convenient for me. His receptionist was kind and courteous and scheduled an appointment the next day. While I was on my way to the appointment my boss called and said she needed back at the office to woo a new client. When Dr. Healley saw me I explained my situation and he was very sympathetic and professional. Other doctors that have treated me would have been irritated that I was in a rush but Dr. Healley was very gracious. He checked my ear told me I need antibiotics and said we could do a full physical another time. I was out the door within five minutes. All in all I feel that it was a real stroke of good luck that Dr. Healley is now my doctor."
"I recently visited Dr. Brassard for an appointment. The office staff were very cordial with getting me in without having to wait for weeks. I was skeptical at first, but after I researched his resume, I felt comfortable in seeing him. Not only is he accredited with numerous affiliations and achievements, but he's also been a professor. He took the time to explain my options, risks, and current research. I felt that he was speaking "to me" and not "at me." One can always tell that someone enjoys their craft, once they decide to teach it to others. I would highly recommend him to family and friends. "
"Dr Mohammed M. Elahi is a pleasure to work with and I personally and highly recommend him. At first I was a little hesitant as this was my first time going through any kind of cosmetic work. Dr. Elahi made me feel comfortable and at ease when throughout my whole face lift procedure. He answered any and every question I had and his staff was also just as kind and helpful. After the several days of recovery, I got the results that I was looking for and I feel like a new person. I will definitely use Dr Elahi's services in the future If I consider getting more work done. "
"Dr. Brassard and his entire staff was courteous and polite. His was very nice and is a very good surgeon. I would definitely go to his practice again for anyy work that i needed."
"Dr Greyvenstein was able to see me as a same day appointment. I had woken up with a strange rash on my chest and needed it checked out. He was very caring and listened to all my concerns. He was also very thorough in his diagnosis and took the time to make sure he was providing the right medication and understood what type of rash I had. He explained everything to me in detail and did not leave untill I fully understood what I needed to do when I got home for treatment. I was really impressed with Dr Greyvenstein. I will definitely be seeing him again and suggest you do as well!"
"Dr. Nave is a very kind, open, and welcoming doctor. She puts me at ease the moment I walk through her door. She understands my motivation for having this type of work (Botox, body contouring, etc.) done and is so willing to work with me to get the results I want!"
"Recently I moved to Courtice, Ontario after my husband got transferred. I have two children, ages 2 and 5 and knew that the move would be very difficult for them seeing as we moved from the states. Within the first month of moving in, our youngest child, Melanie, fell ill with the stomach flu and I began my frantic search for a new physician to replace our old doctor. After doing research on the internet, I came upon Dr. Arnold Lurie and am very pleased with my choice. Dr. Lurie was very friendly and understanding and always makes sure to fully explain what is going on so I am able to understand. Dr. Lurie is also very patient with my children and makes them comfortable, which I am very appreciative of. I can not praise their nurses or receptionists enough! Unlike many doctors, Dr. Lurie does not keep you waiting hours on end and does not appear to rush you. Overall, Dr. Lurie has made our move to Courtice much easier and I am very pleased with him as a doctor and would recommend him to anyone looking for a family practitioner. "
"Dr. Backstein was a fantastic surgeon and a pleasure to have as a doctor! I went in for a simple procedure and I was concerned about how it would go. He answered all of my questions and gave me a lot of information about it prior to the surgery. He was kind, friendly, and incredibly warm which helped to ease my mind about the upcoming surgery. By the time we had arranged for the surgery, I was very confident about it. I felt like he truly cared about me as an individual and I felt at ease being in his hands for the surgery. I would definitely recommend him in the future!"
"When we moved to the Winnipeg Manitoba area, we were referred to the Assiniboine Medical Clinic for our new family physician. We had a positive experience starting with calling for the appointment. The office staff was very pleasant and was able to get us in within a couple weeks. Upon arriving at the office, instead of filling out all the new forms ourselves, Dr. Albak took the time to ask us the questions himself, giving us time to better explain our health and family situations. The exam was very thorough and we did not feel rushed. He took the time to explain what he was going and why. Upon completion of the exam, he explained what we should do to better our health, then asked "What will you do?" and then we went from there. I was very pleased with our new doctor."
"I would highly recommend Dr. Eric Bensimon to anyone looking for a skilled and competent cosmetic surgeon. I had been getting Botox treatments for several months but was feeling lackluster about the results, so I decided to bite the bullet and get a facelift. Dr. Bensimon worked closely with me to make me well acquainted and comfortable with what the procedure would be like, so I was confident that he would do a good job. The results were fantastic- friends I hadn't seen in ages complimented me on how "refreshed" I looked without it being obvious that I had work done. Thank you to Dr. Bensimon and his wonderful staff!"
"I could not more highly recommend Dr. Valnicek to anyone looking for reconstructive or plastic surgery. He has a wonderful bedside manner and I always felt as though I was in safe hands. My breast augmentation post mastectomy turned out beautiful. I feel as though I am complete again thanks to Dr. Valnicek."
"This is a review for doctor Mark Mausner. I wanted to write this review because it is rare today to find someone who cares about you. Especially in the medical field. Dark Mausner is very polite and seems to genuinely care about his patients well being. He strives for nothing less than perfection. I will continue to come back to Dr. Mausner for all of my beauty needs. I have found my fountain of youth. Sincerly, The most grateful patient ever."
"When I found out I needed surgery, it made me very nervous. I didn't like the idea of sitting in a room with a bunch of strangers in masks asking me questions about my personal health. Doctor Barnardo and his staff were very warm and friendly, not to mention respectful of my situation. I wasn't overwhelmed with paperwork, or waiting for hours just to sit in a cold room while various people came in and out asking questions and then leaving. One nurse talked me through everything they were doing and helped me relax and feel comfortable the whole time."
"Dr. Pierre Brassard, Md, is an incredible doctor. He takes time when consulting with patients, and listens to their every need and concern. The environment is free of stress, and every person included on the staff is willing to help you and answer any question you may have. The procedures are affordable and you will LOVE YOUR RESULTS!"
"I am writing this review to document a very pleasant experience. Normally going to see a doctor is not something that we look forward to. But if you do find yourself needing a good doctor, I would definitely recommend Dr Grant Ayling of the west coast family practice. Together with the other four doctors, you feel confident and you are treated with respect. Dr. Grant Ayling was friendly and very reassuring. I felt comfortable from the moment he greeted me with a warm smile and a caring face. I would definitely recommend Dr Grant Ayling."
"Dr. Brent Howley and his staff made my experience with a breast reduction surgery a positive one. From my initial visit I felt that Dr. Howley and his associates had my best interests in mind, and they took the time necessary to answer all of my questions and alleviate concerns. As this was a medically recommended procedure, they obtained coverage and out-of-pocket cost information for me prior to scheduling the procedure, and helped to obtain financing to cover the portion of the expense I was responsible. On the day of the procedure I was treated with care and respect every step of the way. The nurse called me at home that evening several hours after I was released, and then again the following day, to be sure that everything was going well in the initial stages of recovery and to answer any additional questions I had before my one week post-op visit. I only wish I had done the surgery sooner! It has now been 3 months, and the difference it has made in my every day life is amazing. I am no longer self conscious in my clothes, or have back and shoulder pain that left me on constant pain medication and dealing with unpleasant side effects. The incisions are healing beautifully, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. I would definitely recommend this practice to others for whatever procedure they may be considering."
"Dr. Georgina Barnardo at the Lakeside Medical Clinic has been my doctor for three years now. I have constantly been impressed with her professionalism, but also her attention to detail and her ability to remember small details about my life that make everything feel personalized. She takes time to listen to my concerns and never makes me feel as though they are unwarranted. Often, she gives me extra health tips throughout my visit, usually tips I would have never otherwise thought about! She usually responds to my calls within the hour and doesn't ever seem to be in a hurry or that my call isn't worth her time. I have been very pleased with Dr. Barnardo and would recommend her to anyone. "
"Dr. Wolf and his staff were very welcoming and professional, from the very first time I called to make and appointment. During my consultation, Dr. Wolf took the time to listen to my questions and concerns and provided honest, thoughtful and helpful answers. I did not feel rushed or pressured, and it seemed like he really wanted to make sure I made the best decision to suit my body type and my needs. He showed me plenty of before and after photos to give me a realistic idea of what my outcome could be and really put me at ease. He was also able to do my botox injection in the same visit, which he did quickly and expertly. I can't wait to schedule my surgery with Dr. Wolf!"
"Doctor Francois Lacombe, was the utmost professional when it came to helping my wife and I bring our brand new baby boy into this world. going above and beyond what we had expected walking into his office in order to make our family only as we could have dreamed of."
"This doctor is the best one I have had so far in all of my years of seeing them. He has all the traits of a real professional. His bedside manner is excellent and he makes sure he answers all of your questions thoroughly. I would recommend Dr. LeBlanc to anyone looking for a new doctor who really cares about your health and well being."
"When I first walked in, I was greeted right a way by the staff. They are very friendly. The place is clean and and inviting. The doctor was very gentle and understood my needs. I didn't feel like i was being pressured. I would definitely go back here. Highly recommended! "
"I went to The Doctors Office for the first time last week, and I was very pleased with the way my husband and I were treated, from the moment we stepped into the reception area all the way through the visit. We saw Dr. Karima Ali, and she was very patient with us. She explained that some additional tests were needed but she had someone verify that our insurance would cover them before we left. We will definitely continue to see her in the future."
"My family and I have been going to Westcoast for a few years now. So far our experience has been exceptional. WHen our 4 year old son came down with the Flu Dr. Ayling happened to be the Doctor on call that night. Since it was after hours we thought we would have to go to the hospital, but Dr. Ayling made himself available to help our son out. We are greatful to have a family practice that cares about its community and patients. We definatly are greatful for not having to spend the night in the E.R. Thanks again Dr. Ayling and the rest of the staff at Westcoast! "
"Dr. Davis is a wonderful physician! First, he came in on-time for the scheduled appointment. If you have had experiences like me, you know we usually wind up waiting 30min, 45min, and sometimes 1 hour for the doctor to actually come in for the appointment. Dr. Davis was on schedule. This impressed me, as it shows he has respect for my time. Meanwhile, from the moment he walked in I had his undivided attention. He was very attentive to my needs, and answered all my questions. He is very easy to talk to about your medical issues. I was also very impressed with his knowledge. Overall, Dr. Davis is exceeded my expectations! "
"I can not say enough wonderful things about Dr. Valnicek and his staff. The staff was so warm and welcoming and I felt right at ease as soon as I walked in the door for my first visit. Aside from being an exceptional surgeon, Dr. Valnicek always treated me with the utmost professionalism and respect. I am thrilled with my results and would recommend Dr. Valnicek and the Okanagan Plastic Surgeons office to everyone. Thank you for a great experience. Another happy patient!"
"Dr.Stalker is a very friendly and knowledgeable doctor! She has a lot of patience and is highly willing to explain everything about your options, medications and procedures to you, and makes great recommendations. She's efficient and doesn't make you wait too long, but gives enough time to each of her patients to make sure you feel comfortable. Plus, she's very reliable with regard to the quality of care you'll get. Excellent doctor!"
"What more can I say, I love Dr. Silverman! He gave me my confidence back and I couldn't be more grateful for this talented and kind doctor! After losing a significant amount of weight, my breasts became saggy and lifeless. I kept thinking about cosmetic surgery but the process was so overwhelming. I wanted a doctor who was exceptionally talented but also someone who would really listen to me. It wasn't until I heard a glowing review of Dr. Silverman from a coworker that I knew that this was the time to seize my opportunity. From the moment I walked into his office, all the way to the follow-up sessions after my breast lift, I felt at ease. Dr. Silverman's credentials are impeccable (he even has hospital privileges at top hospitals) and getting to see photos of his work really eased my mind. He was extremely honest with me about what I could expect from the surgery and how long the recovery time would be. This was the best decision I have ever maid for myself. If you're thinking about cosmetic surgery and you want a talented and caring doctor, you owe it to yourself to look into Dr. Silverman. I hope this review helped! "
"MY VISIT WITH DR.JABLONSKI WAS ABSOLUTELTY WONDERFUL. HE TOOK HIS TIME AND ANSWERED ALL OF MY QUESTIONS. HE WAS TOTALLY PROFESSIONAL, AND HE HAS A GREAT BEDSIDE MANNER. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR.JABLONSKI!"
"Dr. Martin Jugenburg is the best plastic surgeon in Toronto, He is attentive and knowledgeable. I feel like a brand new person, better than ever! I couldn't have asked for better results, no scarring and I look and feel FANTASTIC! His office is beautiful and his staff made me feel so at home! 5 out of 5 stars, I'll be back! "
"Dr. Fernando Luna cares about and listens to me in regards to my health care. I feel like he knows just the right thing to keep me healthy and happy. Thank you Dr. Fernado Luna!"
"Dr. Douglas A. Taranow is a wonderful, compassionate surgeon. I was not surprised to see that he stays up-to-date on all relevant knowledge. Even though other doctors turned me away, I realized it was a blessing in disguise when I was finally referred to him. I am glad he was the doctor to operate on me, instead of the others I saw earlier. Even though my case was difficult, he did a great job and I love the way I look now. No one can tell that I had surgery unless they know exactly where to look for the tiny scars and examine my skin closely. If I ever (God forbid) get in another accident and need more cosmetic surgery, he's the only one I would hire."
"Dr. Bechbache has treated my entire family for the past five years and we absolutely love him! Dr. Bechbache has excellent bedside manner and is considerate and kind when dealing with his patients. When a cyst was found in my neck, Dr. Bechbache did not treat me routinely, like a number, but rather treated me like a friend. His experience and professionalism helped get me through a very scary situation. The typical wait for office visit is about 10 minutes and he takes the time to sit and talk with his patients. I would highly recommend Dr. Bechbache to anyone who is seeking a caring, experienced family doctor. "
"With medical practice being as overburdened and hectic as it is today I was not expecting the level of care and attention that I received from Dr. Greyvenstein. Although it was obvious from the waiting area that the practice was quite busy the doctor took the time to slow down and address my concerns with patience. At no point did he seem harried or willing to just "get on to the next patient". He not only treated me like a person he did it with a smile. "
"Based on recommendations from friends, I sought out Dr. Robert Wolf at Waters Edge for consultation on a tummy tuck procedure. Two abdominal surgeries had left me with an asymmetrical scar and lots of unattractive skin puckering. I was a bit nervous, but the office surroundings were so soothing! I loved the waterfall - very relaxing. I found Dr. Wolf to be extremely professional and highly compassionate. He discussed a number of options with me, and after our meeting I felt very confident in his ability to provide me with a good surgical outcome. I was very pleased with the results of my surgery. I feel like I'm bikini-worthy again and would not hesitate to consult Dr. Wolf again if I have future cosmetic surgery needs."
"Doctor Tinus Wasserfall was a great doctor. My family and I went to him last week. He had a light touch and had a very calming voice. My young son really liked him because he talked about sports with my son. This made my son less nervous. My husband said he was the best doctor he had ever been to. I asked him about the lump that I had been feeling in the back of my throat and gave me multiple reasons why it was there. He gave me a medication which has helped the lump decrease in size. He even checked up on my a few days ago to make sure the medicine was working. This showed me that he cared a lot. As for the facilities, they were clean and colorful. Great for my son to ease his nerves. Doctor Wasserfall is a wonderful doctor and we will be back to see him again!"
"I came to Dr. Keller at the Baywood clinic for laser hair removal on my body. As I am Asian, my underarms and other parts of my body look terrible with normal hair growth. I was extremely embarrassed by my dark underarms and was shamed to wear tank tops when I was visited my family back in Thailand as their is such pressure to maintain flawless skin. I decided it was time to remove my underarm hair forever as I had a wedding back in Thailand coming up and I wanted to feel confident in the photos. Having reviewed Dr. Keller's credentials and the fact he is an Examiner for the American Board of Laser medicine, I felt at ease, even if this is just a minor procedure. I can say that during all treatments he was extremely professional, timely and the cost was competitive for a highly trained doctor. The hair removal went as planned and I am excited for my upcoming wedding now that I have even more confidence. I would not hesitate to recommend Dr. Keller to friends and family and want to thank everyone at the Baywood Clinic for their excellent service and professionalism."
" Dr.Christopher Forrest is one of our best pediatric surgeons at the Sick Kids hospital. He performs all kinds of surgeries, from tumor removal to plastic and cosmetic surgeries. He's been doing successful surgeries for an exceptional amount of years and it shows in his work and in the way he cares for his patients. Dr.Forrest works very well with the children. He will do whatever he can to make sure that each of his patients is comfortable before and after surgery. If your in need of a execllent pediatric surgeon ,look for Dr. Christopher Forrest of Sick Kids hospital."
