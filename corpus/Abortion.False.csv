"Abortion should be illegal. Conception is when a molecule becomes a human being. Terminating a pregnancy is the same as killing. God will punish anyone who commits murder. It doesn't matter how that pregnancy came to be, the child has a right to live, and the government should punish the woman the same as they would any killer."
"An unborn child is still a living being, who should be given the rights any other human has. This includes the right to life. No person, including the mother of an unborn child has the right to kill a living human being. If a woman finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, she has the option to put the baby up for adoption. There are many loving couples who would love the opportunity to adopt a baby."
"Medical procedures save lives. Abortion is consonant with the termination of lives. Changing the language to describe abortion doesn't avoid this. People should not be allowed to choose to end the lives of others, whether that is abortion, capital punishment, murder, decisions to go to war etc. Let's help to provide adequate sex education, contraception, social services, support, safe streets to walk on, protection from male violence etc., before the perceived need for abortion occurs."
"Abortion should be legal and is a good thing in all cases. It is the parents right to do whatever they want. There should be no time limit on abortions whatsoever. People should be rewarded financially for abortions for their service in keeping world population down."
"Its not good...I am not completely against it. It depends on the situation the girl or woman may be in. I do believe if its going to be done, it needs to be done early on.."
"It is the woman's choice whether she keeps or aborts her unborn baby. It is her body and therefore should be her choice. The fetus is not really a human being at that early stage. The fetus becomes a human being only after about 5 or 6 months of age. So having an abortion is not the same as killing a baby or a human being. If a woman does not feel she can raise a baby, it is better for her to abort than bring an unwanted child into the world."
"A woman has free will and free choice over what goes on in her body. If the child has not been born, it is under her control. Often the circumstances an unwanted child is born into are worse than death. The mother has the responsibility to choose the best course for her child and herself."
""I believe abortion is wrong. I do not think that innocent babies should have to suffer for mistakes an adult makes. If someone finds themselves in a position where they are unable or unwilling to care for a baby, they should give the child up for adoption. There are many families willing and wanting children and adoption can help not only the birth mothers of these ""unwanted"" children, but it can also help a couple wanting a child that is unable to conceive. ""
""Abortion is a great option because children shouldn't be born into households that can't raise a child well. It is a great way to keep the surplus population down, allowing for a cleaner less crowded world. I think that a zygote or fetus isn't a person in the mother's womb until the fetus has developed recognizable human features; otherwise it is an unfeeling, unthinking, soulless growth inside the woman and is fine to abort without feelings of remorse and guilt. Abortion is a great option for young women who find themselves in a situation they are not prepared to handle, and could potentially ruin their lives. ""
"I think abortion should absolutely be illegal. From the minute that sperm hits the egg, life is created. It would unfair to take away the life of an innocent child that has done nothing to the mother. Families can always put babies up for adoption, and even choose the adoptive families if they would like. For teen mothers, there are homes where they can go for their duration of their pregnancy so they do not have to face ridicule. Taking away a life on purpose is considered a criminal offense in every state and life in jail without parole is usually the sentence. Nothing is different from taking away the life of an innocent child, women should be punished for killing a life they helped create. Overrall, abortion wrong and immoral and shoule be illegal."
"God states that you cannot have abortions, as you are killing your children. You will go to hell, and that is as simple as it gets. Removing a life from the womb is the same as murdering a living human. It is wrong."
"I Think everyone needs to think about the other person here THE BABY !! Women know all the side effects of sex .I know the power of love and attraction is strong but what should always be on the back of her mind is that a dead child is not worth it. I think that a year of heartache (pregnancy and birth and time to heal ) is worth a babies life. Adoption is a gift to the world and the child .I think there needs to be more organasations to help young and older women go through this process ."
"There are somethings too ghastly to even debate. Probably the most simplistic of these subjects is whether or not it is ok to kill another human being. This may be the worst thing anyone can do, rob someone of their god given right to life. Who are we to decide who lives or dies especially when we made the choice to concieve a life. This is why abortion is wrong. It would never have been necessary without the initial conception. If you do the crime you do the time."
"Abortion is a good idea in many circumstances. Modern genetic testing can determine whether the embryo is likely to suffer from any birth defects or genetic disorders - if so, terminate the pregnancy and try again. Raising a child is expensive, and for poor women the cost will largely be borne by the taxpayers in the form of government programs such as WIC, SCHIP, and food assistance programs. Subsidized on-demand abortions would be vastly less expensive, and permit the former mother to return to the work force and improve her lot. Finally, while the United States does not experience the crippling food shortages of some developing nations, we are developing an excess population. We consume energy out of proportion to our population and are experiencing increasing unemployment as jobs are sent to other countries. We do not need more people, and terminating unwanted pregnancies would go some way toward reducing our ecological footprint, while allowing the rest of us to live a better life."
"I believe that abortion is horrible. Abortion is getting rid of a part of you. It is like murdering a human being. There are ways to take care of a child if you have to. If you Weren't ready for it you shouldn't have done the act that conceived it."
"Abortion is a very acceptable way to end an unwanted pregnancy. Every woman has the right to make the choice of what to do with her body and if being pregnant and giving birth isn't what she wants then having an abortion is strictly her decision and right. A baby isn't really a human being until it is born and therefore abortion is not murder. The fact of the matter is that there are alreay too many children in this world and not enough parents who truly want them and this contributes to the high crime rate among teenagers."
"I believe that abortion should be outlawed under any circumstances. Never should a fetus be punished by death because of bad decisions made by mothers. If you don't want the baby after it is born, adoption is always an option. Abortion is a brutal way of getting rid of bad mistakes. Fetuses have rights at the moment of conception they become human beings. We do not get rid of our unwanted people by killing them off."
"A child gains full rights at the moment it is not dependent upon the mother for life. Until that moment of birth, the mother's rights to life, healthy, security and control of her body over-ride those of the potential child. Thus she may end the pregnancy at any time until birth (or perhaps legal person-hood). She retains the choice to bear the child and put it for adoption, as well as the right to not bear the child at all."
"I am me. If I own anything else in the world, it is me. I choose what I eat. I choose when I sleep. I am in control of me. If I choose to abort what is in my body, it is up to me. I am me."
"Life begins at conception. There is no way around it--abortion is murder. The taking of an innocent life is wrong no matter the circumstance. If the pregnancy might kill the mother, then it is God's will that she might die. God has a plan for all of us and death is part of that plan. It is not our role to choose when another person may live or die."
"Abortion goes directly against biblical teaching. There are many, many families who wish to provide good, happy homes for children of unplanned pregnancies. Why choose to kill your baby that was created out of your irresponsible actions? Do two wrongs make a right? At least, give your baby the opportunity to grow up in a loving family where hopefully they will learn to have responsible sex practices."
"Everyone has the right to live, including unborn children. Abortion should be viewed as homicide. They have the right to live their lives and fulfill their dreams. Many people would love to adopt children and couldn't, so if you cannot keep your child, you should allow people to adopt your baby and give it a chance to live. People should take responsibility for their actions so if they accidentally have a baby, they need to deal with the consequences. In some countries, the population is growing negatively so every baby should be born and raised."
"Children are God's greatest gift! Then why abort? If you have concieved that means God Himself has planned to gift you another child! Or, its His plan to bring another life on earth! Then who are you to interfere in His doings?! Abortion should be considered illegal worldwide, and people following it should be punished. Abortion many-a-times leads to complications in your body also. God may punish you by making you unable to concieve ever after an abortion. So beware and don't do it ever!"
"If a woman does not want to get pregnant she can just stop having sex until she meets the right person. She is responsible all the time she is fertile to use a pill or get a shot of contraceptive. A woman must force a man to use a condom. It is good for her to get pregnant and not play with sex and life. Sex is for making baby not for fun."
"I believe abortion is murder. When a woman becomes pregnant that is a life, not an object to be aborted. I believe that adoption is the choice to be made if the mother decides that she is not ready or cannot support a child. I belive under no circumstances she the answer to an unwanted pregnancy be abortion."
"I believe abortion should be against the law. Having an abortion is the same as taking a human life. There is not one reason to ever have to preform an abortion. Every human being from the time of conception has a right to life."
"Abortion is evil. Abortion kills babies daily. We should not allow others to kill their unborn children no matter what the cost. It is our moral obligation to stop others from committing homicide. If the child were born we would not allow a parent to kill their child."
"I make my position known that I support abortion. With teen pregnancy rates at all time highs, this gives our younger generation an option to continue in childhood thierselves. This will keep our young mothers off of welfare and our taxpayers from footing the bill. I feel it is a womans right to choose when she becomes a parent and not pregnancy choose her."
"Woman have the freedom to vote, the freedom to hold the same jobs that men do, and are equal in everyway. So why do we feel that we can control there body when it comes to having a baby? Abortion should be legal and offered as an accepted choice for every woman. Pregancy is demanding on a woman in many ways. We can treat many serious illnesses to prolong life and make it as best as possible for everyone but then tell woman that if they become pregant and do not want the child that they have to anyway. How is that fair? Is forcing woman to have unwanted children going to make them into great parents? We have become to far in society to turn back now. Let woman have the freedom of choice."
"Abortion is a medical practice that should be outlawed because it is taking away the life of a defenseless baby that would have had a chance to live. This is basically murder, the destruction of life. If we allow something like abortion to remain illegal, hundreds of thousands of potential adults will never have gotten the chance to live. They will miss out on an opportunity to carve their own destiny, simply because the mother choose to abort."
"I do not support a woman's right to choose. A life begins at conception, and abortion is murdering an innocent child. God chooses when a life should begin, and we should accept any life as a gift from God. There is a good alternative to killing an innocent child if a woman is not ready for parenthood. Adoption gives a child to a couple who cannot have one themselves, who are willing to give a loving home to otherwise unwanted children."
"Abortion should be banned at all times. In many states, the murder of a pregnant mother counts as two murders, therefore it follows that the legal standard in those states should be imposed on the mother, who by the premeditated death of her unborn child, has committed the same crime as the double murder, by taking one life which counted as a second murder for the other perpetrator. Further, the unborn child is a sentient being, and expresses many complex emotions and behaviors while developing in the protected environment of the womb."
"I believe that the government should decide for people whether they are allowed to have an abortion or not. This is because the answer is simple: nobody should be allowed to have an abortion. If the government makes it illegal then many thousands of babies will have their lives saved each year. Besides, any woman who is willing to take the risk to have an illegal abortion deserves whatever consequences come as a result. She is a murderer."
"Life begins at conception. Life is sacred and a gift from god. It is a sin against god to interfere with his sacred plan so we cannot allow abortion. It is gods will that you get pregnant who are you to question god? There are plenty of loving families that are unable to have children so adoption is the solution to this problem."
"A woman has the right to choose what to do with her own body. A fetus in the womb is in fact part of her own body, because her body produced it, and it depends entirely on what she supplies in order to even exist. She can do what she likes with it, with no moral implications at all. Even conceding that this is a separate organism, it would be a kind of parasite using her body to survive. Any person has the right to rid themselves of a parasite, no matter how it came about, and even if it happens to be human. It's her body, her decision, and nobody else's business."
"I am a man, so abortion does not directly affect my body. However, I do not support womens' right to choose whether or not they carry the babies growing inside their bodies to term. I believe that every human life is sacred, and has the right to be protected by the state. This right to life would extend to abortion because the fetus is a living being which is not merely part of its mother's body (unlike say, an organ). If I were to get a woman pregnant, I would hope our legal and medical system would encourage us to carry the baby to term and create new life, rather than destroy it."
"I would be against abortion. Think about all the families who desperatly want children and can not concieve.Women can give there babies up for adotion if they can't take care of them or don't want to have them. There are millions of women every year who go to great lengths to have babies and never have the joy of having a family.Why take another life when there is someone out there who can give your baby the love and joy and life they deserve?"
"Abortion saves lives, A child can live a life in a orphanage or foster home with some one else. It is a tax deduction to those helping this child. The parents sresponsiblity shifts to those more fortunate to care for a child."
"Abortion is murder plain and simple. You are taking something that has begun to live and destroying it. Too many people in our society are irresponsible and use abortion as a form of birth control. Thousands of women who are unable to have their own children are willing to adopt these unwanted babies. Is murder okay just because somebody doesn't want to be inconvienced for a few months?"
"Every woman has a right to choose. Life does not start until the baby is born. No one has the right to tell another person what to do with their body. Abortion is no big deal."
"Abortion is a woman's right. The government, state or federal, has no right to regulate what a woman can do with her own uterus. It is a woman's body and therefore the woman's choice what she does with that body. Banning abortion would not stop people from seeking to abort their unwanted pregnancies, it would just cut off their safe and medically sound avenues for getting an abortion. Denying a woman the ability to control her own uterus is completely wrong for the government to do."
"Abortion should not be legal as society may be misuse it to abort girl child as is common in male centric societies like India. Parents who are not of a sound mind may decide wrongly about the fate of their kid. Families may force abortion on girls when the family honor is at issue as is the case in Arab world and south east Asia. Kids with diseases or handicap may be at the receiving end of abortion as well."
"I believe if you want to have sex go ahead and have it unprotected. You can always run to the nearest doctor to have your mistakes taken care of. If you want to have sex without the worry of a child then the abortion control shouldn't say a thing about it after all you are an adult."
"Life begins at conception. Destorying that life in any form, abortion included, is murder. It is God's will that a woman is impregnated, no matter what the circumstances and that child should be carried to term and born. If a woman does not want a child, she should not have sex."
"Every woman has the right to do what she wants. It's her body. Abortions should be legalized in all countries. It's the solution to an unwanted birth."
"Abortions should be outlawed and anyone found having an abortion or performing abortions should be immediately arrested, charged and tried for crimes against humanity. Women should be more responsible with their bodies. Abstinence would be preferable, but if a woman chooses to give herself away then she should at least be responsible enough to use birth control. If a woman is a victim of sexual assault and finds herself pregnant as a result then it is the will of God and she should carry the child to term, give birth, and either raise the child or give it up for adoption. There are plenty of desirous couples out there desperately wanting a baby to love and raise. I would support a constitutional amendment making abortion illegal in the United States."
"Abortion needs to be a right guaranteed to all women. Women can have careers derailed, relationships with parents ruined, and a great deal of shame brought on them by an unwanted pregnancy. And the right to choose to terminate that pregnancy should be guaranteed to the women. A women's body is her own, and no government should tell her what she can or cannot do with her body, and what she can and cannot do with her life."
"Women shouldn't have a choice because it is a life that they are killing. If they were so against having a child in the first place then they should have done better measures in preventing it. Human life is precious even in it's early stages. Women should have to pay for their mistakes if they want to keep making them."
"Abortion should be outlawed. It strikes at our moral fabric and punishes the helpless. Unfortunate as it may be for victims of crime, we must see the good that can come from a tragedy. Adoption is a viable alternative to termination. Although unplanned pregnancies can be troublesome, with proper legislation, we can insure the rights and care of the unborn. Our children and children to be must be protected at all costs, as they are future of humanity."
"Abortion is a dangerous way of performing birth control. The bible states that murder of any kind is a sin. A child's life begins at conception and nobody has the right to take life from anyone, regardless of circumstances around the pregnancy. Every life conceived deserves to be lived."
"Abortion is murder. How can a person make a decision to end the life of another's, when that other individual involved has hardly had the chance to live yet? Abortion should be completely and utterly banned. Even if incest, sexual abuse, or rape is the case, abortion should be illegal, because there are far too many childless American couples who would provide loving homes to these children, were they available for adoption. It is my conviction that once a life has begun to grow inside of you, it is no longer your decision or that of anyone else whether or not that life shall be permitted to exist and grow."
"I believe abortion should be accepted nationwide. A person should be able to choose whether or not they want the responsibility of parenthood. Sometimes babies are conceived on accident. Therefore, it should be perfectly fine for an unprepared woman to abort a baby."
"Abortion should not be allowed as many women today use it as a recreational tool to prevent an unwanted birth on their whims. Life begins at day 3 and by using abortion, it is a death sentence. Those that were raped should be given the information so that they can give the child up for adoption if they so wish. Those that are overwhelmed with a pregnancy due to their young age or due to their marital status should be given counseling and support so that they can be equipped with the information needed to raise a child. Abortion should not be an option so that we can have more responsible decisions when it comes to sex."
"I believe in abortion 100% If you mess up, you always have the option for abortion. Abortion is perfect when teenagers have unprotected sex and become pregnant. It is hard enough to raise an animal on your own if your a teenager, i cannot even imagine the responsibility of raising a child! Abortion is the last option you have if your going to have a baby when you do not want to have a baby."
"Abortion should be legal all the time. Sometimes women have no other choice. It is a valid form of birth control. The baby inside is not old enough to know it is about to be killed, therefor it is not a form of murder. When you are not ready to have a child, you should be able to dispose of it, no questions asked. It is no one's business but your own."
"It is sad that so many religious folk mask their disdain for women in the cloak of God and his ancient scriptures. Denial of a woman's right to abortion is simply one facet of the agenda of male domination: To keep the female in the house, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom. Such men are so threatened by general female participation in society that seek often even to ban the use of contraceptives, so that the sexual act -- free of consequene for the man -- saddles the woman with nine months of labor, and then 18 years of childrearing, effectively shutting her out of society. How sad and pathetic!"
"Abortion is a woman's choice, and government has no right to make the decision for her. If a woman is raped, then it is fine for her to have an abortion. She did not want the baby anyways. A baby's life does not start until the point at which they can survive outside of the womb."
"I believe abortion is always wrong. It doesn't matter when it takes place, what the circumstances are. A child is a child, whether there is a heartbeat or not, whether the fertilized egg has even implanted yet. It is still a child."
"Abortions are wrong in so many ways. The instant a child is conceived, they are a human being, and should have the rights of every human being. Terminating a pregnancy is murder, because you are ending a human life. Everyone who takes part in an abortion is a murderer, and should be punished. There are many options for unwanted children that don't involve killing them, including adoption, and foster homes."
""The ""baby"" needs to live under any and all circumstances, even the rape of the mother or incest. It is not the fault of the ""baby"" how it came into existence. God wants this baby to be born so it should be. There will always be a home available for any and all babies""
"Every embryo is a human life from the second of conception. Once a sperm and egg unite they become a person with full human rights to life. To have an abortion is murder and it should be illegal no matter what the circumstances. Abortion is murder of the worst sort - the murder of innocents. Women should not be allowed to kill their babies just because they are an inconvenience. Abortion is murder."
"Women do not have the right to choose where abortion is concerned. It is another life the woman is taking and no one has the right to take another life. Any other opinion grossly infringes upon the rights of the newborn and the rights of humans to exist in general."
"Abortion is tantamount to murder, and thus should be considered a crime. Life begins at the second conception takes place, and to destroy that life is wrong. To let unscrupulous women murder their one-night stand mistakes because of their poor planning is horrendous. These unborn children deserve a right to life."
"If you make the choices to be unprepared in the first place you are making the choice to have a baby if that should happen. Life starts a conception and every life is sacred and important. It is never okay to take a life. More education needs to be made in order to teach people about being cautious and practicing abstinance."
"Abortion is good for most people especially those women who have been victims of a sex crime. How could anyone really want them to carry a child of a rapist in their womb for nine months and then give it away. Who is to say that if that child is a boy he won't turn out with the same views as his father. Most criminals inherit some type of their behavior from their actual parents. There is also the view of freedom of choice if a woman wants to abort her child she does have the ability to do so without anyone getting in her way."
"I do not think you should have an abortion for any reason. It is the consequences of life to deal with whatever you have to and if you get pregnant so be it. If your child has severe birth defects there are ways to take care of that child. There are always other options other than abortion."
"Just like I don't have the right to tell a man what to do with his body, no one has the right to tell me what I can or cannot do as a woman, with my body. If a pregnancy is an inconvenience I shouldn't have to be inconvenienced. This is my body. After all, it's just a mass of cells. It can't think, breath or even take care of itself. The US Gov't says abortion is legal. Leave it at that."
"Life begins at conception. That takes precedence over anything else. There are so many forms of contraception out there that there should be no such thing as an unexpected pregnancy. Women need to take responsibility before sex and have an appropriate contraceptive to avoid unwanted pregnancy"
""I believe a woman has the right to control her body and do what she wants. Any woman should be able to terminate an unwanted pregnancy for any reason that occurs. Abortion is not killing or murdering, because it is merely tissue that is growing inside the womb - not a real human being. In fact, a fetus is not truly a human being until it is in the 3rd trimester or even when it is outside the womb. A woman or young girl's goals or desires in her life should not be interrupted or changed just because she is pregnant. An unwanted child should not be allowed to live; in this way the mother is benefitted in the best way possible. The mother's wishes are more important than the baby in the womb. Abortion should be allowed at any stage of pregnancy -- whatever will help the mother most in her situation.""
"Abortion should be allowed without any restraining factors. People should be allowed to get of unwanted pregnancies if they wish to. Some regions have high abortion rates, since people want male children, and law should not interfere with this. There should be complete independence about abortion, with the mother being the main person who decides about going for abortion."
"Abortion is not murder, as the fetus is not alive. Abortion should be available to any woman who needs it. Its available for those women who do not want a child. Taking away abortion rights would force parenthood teenagers and women who aren't ready. This would possibly result in neglect of the child."
"I think abortion is fine for anyone for any reason. I would have an abortion if I found out I was pregnant and feel its better than being on drugs all the time to keep yourself from being pregnant. I think that abortion should be used more. More people need to have abortions to prevent overpopulation of the species and to get rid of unwanted babies."
"Abortion is murder! Life starts at the moment of conception. All life is God given, and you are thereby killing a little part of God as well as your child. Any and all life must be allowed to continue from conception to it's natural end."
"Abortion is and should always be legal. If it isn't legal then women would be harming themselves and breaking the law by seeking illegal abortions. Since men don't have to bear the burden they shouldn't have a say in the matter of abortion. Life doesn't begin at conception, but I can't tell you when it does start - that is for a woman to decide. It is her body and she can do what she wishes with it."
"To consider abortion wrong or even murder is to place force a minority's religious beliefs on the majority. It also might place a woman's life in jeopardy. Every woman should have the right to choose what to do with her own body. The fetus, in its inability to survive apart from the woman's body, proves that it is not really alive apart from the mother. Life begins when the baby emerges from the womb, or at least when it could survive on its own, not when it exists in a pre-human state. You can only murder a human."
"I believe that abortion is murder and should not be allowed under any circumstances. It is against God's law. Abortion ends the life of an unborn child, an innocent baby who should not be punished by the poor choices or circumstances of the mother. Abortion is an unwritten holocaust, allowed by a society that is either uncaring or has been deceived as to abortion's true Satanic nature. It is in our best interest as a society to outlaw abortion and punish doctors who perform them if we don't want God to withdraw his blessing from America."
"Abortion is the taking away of life. Conception creates a living child and abortion kills that child. It is no less than murder, it should be judged no differently than infanticide. What difference lies between the mother who drowns her baby and the mother who aborts? This is the life of a helpless being that each is ending."
"A child is created at the moment of conception. It has a heart and a soul and to have an abortion is murder. All people deserve the right to life and just because some teenage girl makes a bad choice does not mean that a baby should die."
"Abortion is, in my opinion, the only choice when you find yourself with an unwanted pregnancy. I feel that when educating our children about sex and its consequences, abortion should be included as an option for birth control. I believe that any woman who is raped should have an abortion rather than having a child that reminds them of their pain or giving the child up for adoption. I also feel that there are not enough abortion clinics in our country. I feel that abortions should be made more affordable so that all women, rich or poor, can more easily use it when needed."
""Life is sacred. In the Bible it declares ""thou shalt not kill."" To abort a fetus is to kill an innocent and living human being. No one should have the right to take the life of another, even if it is growing inside of them. Babies can feel and respond to outside stimuli very early in pregnancy, even before the three month mark which is when most laws place the deadline for abortion.""
"Abortion is murder. When you are aborting, you are taking away a life that may have had a wonderful future. Abortion should not be legal because it is not fair for a baby to have their life taken away, by someone else's decisions. If the person didn't want the child, they should have taken better precautions. Now they have to face the consequences."
"There are too many kids that need to be taken care of already, and if we can control the population, we might as well. Abortion saves time and energy when it comes to the cost and effort put forth to raise a child."
"I am pro-life because I believe that we become sentient beings from the moment of conception. As humans it is immoral to kill another human being - this is called murder and puts you in jail. This concept should be no different for a fetus. A fetus has as much right to live as anybody else already living."
"Abortion is one of the core beliefs our Founding Father had, but never wrote about. Our history is clear that our liberty is based on a freedom from encumbrances placed on us by a well meaning, but potentially wrong government. A woman's right to control herself and her body is the final incarnation of those beliefs. It is the recognition that governments have proper limits on their ability to invade our homes, our minds, and our bodies. While the nature of abortion have moved from the clinic entrance to the pill bottle, much still needs to be done to insure this basic right remains protected in the future."
"Abortion gives a woman the right to control her own life. It ensures that a woman does not have to spend her entire life reminded of a mistake that she made. It is a simple solution to a not so simple problem. Abortion gives a woman the chance to move on from past mistakes and not have to live with the consequences. Having a child is not right for everyone, this is one solution."
"I think that any pregnancy needs to be carried through to the end with no outside interruption of the process. In order for this belief to be covered by laws, I would have to blanket the whole process as bad or specifically decide which situations to exclude as bad, like medical necessity or rape cases. But all that matters is that when life is started, at conception, that life has the right to fully run its natural course. There is no gray area and the process of abortion must be fully condemned."
"Abortion should be a choice that we have in life. If it is not the 'right time' or if something was 'wrong', abortion could be an option. Women should have a choice to terminate the pregnancy if it doesn't fit their present life situation. By having abortion as an option, there wouldn't be unwanted or uncared for children to worry about in the world."
""Abortion: AKA murder. Your unborn child has no defenses, cannot speak out in its own name, cannot tell you how much it wants to live. Abortion: AKA early term infanticide, should not be allowed to continue one more moment. How many partial birth abortions need to be done before the world sees that God is right? The only ""choice"" you need to make is the babies name, upon birth.""
"Conservatives who strictly vote for a candidate based on the abortion issue is a conscientious voter. Abortion, the killing of unborn children, is the moral determinate of the character of a candidate. Any candidate that will defend the life and rights of the unborn is a candidate with the moral standing and righteous that will receive the blessing of clear vision. A person who values life will make all the right value decisions. A candidate's stance against abortion is the one and true test of character, leadership, and value."
"Abortion should be an option. Especially in the case of incest, rape or serious health risk for the mother, I believe that abortion should be permitted. Life should not be regarded as being present until past the twelve week gestational period. A female should not have to be forced to give birth to a child that she did not wish to conceive or which may cause great harm to own well-being. The life of the mother should always come first."
"I think abortion is one's own personal decision and no body should interfere in that. People must be allowed to decide for themselves whether they want to have the child or not. There can be several reasons why the person would want to abort the child. So only the parents know better whether it's the right time for them or not, they will be able to support the child or not, etc, etc."
"Abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. Making abortion illegal will only make women more promiscuous and proliferate premartal sex among teenagers because they will abortion as a form of birth control. It is murder and is wrong and immoral. Anyone who participates in abortion should go to jail and will end up in hell."
"My position on abortion is pro-life. Basically, we are taught that life is precious,a gift and to take that gift would be devistating to the young mother who made that choice. If the child is not wanted there are many parents who cannot have a child and would gladly adopt the baby with even the option of keeping the mother in the picture throughout the child's life. Life should not be wasted. If the mother is young and decides to keep the child, it may be tough, but hopefully the father is involved and wants to keep the child also. In that case, it may be a struggle, but as the parents grow, the child will grow to make a strong family unit. Yes, Life should be kept, not wasted."
"While people are entitled to their freedoms, one of our freedoms is not to take another life. Despite the fact that this life is occuring within someone else, it does not give them the right to snuff it out. Life begins at conception, period. If a woman does not want to keep her child, there are more than enough willing couples to take on the responsibility and joy of parenting a child."
"Abortion is wrong. Women who get abortions need to take responsibility for their actions. Just because they were irresponsible doesn't mean that an innocent baby should die! There should be no exceptions for cases of rape or incest as all conceptions are a blessing. Teenagers need to accept responsibility for their actions and raise their children. Instead of abortion, why don't people adopt their unwanted babies out? People who have abortions are selfish people who do not value human life."
"I think abortion is a very pleasant thing. It is certain that all a human being is is meat. A fetus has no worth whatsoever, so it doesn't matter at all if you destroy it. No one should ever have any qualms about having an abortion."
"Every fertilized egg is a baby and has the right to life. This right should trump any wants of the impregnated female and society should protect the baby before and after birth regardless of how unwanted it is. No exceptions should be made for abortion, e.g. rape or incest. Physicians should lose their license to practice medicine and have the appropriate charges filed against them for performing abortions at any stage of pregnancy for any reason, even the females health. Males are equal partners in conception, pregnancy and birth."
"The abortion it such a crime, because when a women decide have sexual intercourse with a men without protection knows that it's almost a sure thing her pregnancy. Besides, all the religions in the world condemn the abortion like a murdering. Abortion is evil, if you support or animate it, your final destination surely will be the hot hell. In the abortion, the surgeon is the executor, and the denaturalizated mother is the stone-cold judge dictating the final solution. Please, don't abort: Let your child born. Give her/him a second chance."
"Abortion is always always wrong. It's murder. Life begins at conception and cannot just be thrown away. Women should have to have approval from her doctor and spouse before she makes that choice. In a perfect world, the government would just ban abortion completely."
"Abortion is evil for a number reasons. First it is a crime against God and Life, because every life has a meaning and is valuable by itself. We have not the right to decide if a handicapped boy is or not happy to be alive, because the ways of God are mysterious. Second it is a crime against Nature, since we are born to breed and multiply: if everybody aborts humans would disappear. And it is a crime against Logic, since there is no reason to abort when there are so many orphanages available."
