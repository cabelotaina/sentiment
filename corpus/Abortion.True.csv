"Abortions should be legal. I think that women have the right to choose what to do with their own bodies. A government should not interfere with how a woman deals with her pregnancy. Only she knows the truth behind the conception--- there could be birth defects, maybe she was raped or had an incestuous relationship. She should be able to decide if she wants to terminate her pregnancy."
"Abortion, in the United States, should be a basic right to all women. Women should have the right to do with their bodies what they see fit. As long as the fetus would not be viable outside of the mother's body, it is not a living child. Until the time that the fetus can be considered a living child, the mother's rights should always come before the rights of the fetus. Religious beliefs are many and varied, but should not play a role in whether or not abortion is legal. There are a variety of reasons a woman might choose to terminate the pregnancy, and there should be nothing to stop her from doing so. If abortion is illegal, a woman who wants to terminate a pregnancy will still do so, but most likely in a more dangerous way, causing injury to herself in the process."
"I consider myself reasonable pro-choice. I believe abortion is a nesscessary evil. I don't think having an abortion is to be ashamed of, but it's definitely nothing to be proud of. Abortion isn't entirely 'nice', but the lives of unwanted kids can be horrific, with a resentful mother/family, dodgy care system, many opportunities for all kinds of abuse. Militant pro-choicers are just as much as an annoyance as militant pro-lifers."
"I am not sure about my exact stance on abortion. I never really gave it that much thought. I know people who have had abortions and I do not judge them as bad people. It perhaps is better to avoid bringing an unwanted child into the world, although it is true that the embryo is possibly a human and we cannot be sure of the suffering that it will experience due to being killed. Now that I am thinking about this I think that perhaps it would be better on the whole that people should really think long and hard and only go through with this in extreme circumstances. It could be argued that this is murder. We are not free to treat our children in anyway we see fit. they are not our possesions."
"unless the woman is at risk for any serious complications. Also, abortion is killing a child in my opinion. But, of course, if its a child we are talking about to have an abortion because of a rape, then I would think that abortion is the answer."
"Thou shalt not kill. An unborn baby should not be killed. The soul enters the mother's body at the time of conception. So when you abort your baby, you are killing, murdering, a human being. This is wrong. Period. If you do it, you have become a murderer. Why would you want to kill a human being? You will suffer much regret and remorse for doing so. So, please do not do it."
"I believe abortion is not an option. Once a life has been conceived, it is precious. No one has the right to decide to end it. Life begins at conception, because without conception, there is no life."
"I believe a woman should have the right to choose to have an abortion. There are many different circumstances that could cause a woman to want or need an abortion. If the pregnancy will jeopardize the woman's physical health abortion would be a choice she might need to be available. If the woman was a victim of rape and becomes pregnant abortion should definitely be a choice she should have available. I do however think that the time frame of when a woman can have an abortion should be change. I think an early abortion or first trimester abortion would be the ideal. If the fetus is viable or in the second trimester I don't believe that a doctor should perform and abortion."
"" To tell the truth I believe abortion can be a very complicated issue about which people can be very passionate about. That being said, ""fundamentally"" (pun intended), I believe abortion is wrong because at the moment of conception the embryo has all of it's genetic make up that forms a living human being, regardless of what has developed of the child's body; and an abortion is ending that life which under normal circumstances would be born. But to make such a hard and fast moral rule about this isn't what I'd practice in real life. I'd say abortion should never be used as a form of birth control, but there are situations I'm unsure about how I feel concerning abortion. Say if a woman is raped or if having a child would endanger her life, these are just some of the tricky moral dilemmas in dealing with this issue that I can't say what I'd do honestly if confronted with in real life. ""
"I believe that women should have the right to get an abortin. Women who have been raped certainly don't want to carry the rapist's child, and they should absolutely have the right to terminate the pregnancy. If a woman knows that she is not going to love that child or be able to take care of it at all, it's best that the child isn't brought into this harsh world in the frist place. Although adoption is an option, it's still a hasty and long process. It is also unfair to make a woman carry a baby for 9 months, and potentially endanger herself if she is not even willing to take care of the baby. Most women have millions of eggs, and taking one away while it is still a tiny sac isn't probably going to do much harm. Also, to bring more and more babies in this world will only add to the amount of children in non-permanent foster care being bounced around from house to house or living their whole lives without real parents. Ultimately, it should be women's choice, as long as the fetus is 4 months and under."
"Abortion is the loss of a human fetus from the mother. Whether the loss of the fetus is at 1 week after conception or 8 months, if done purposefully it should be treated the same. I believe women should have the right to have an abortion, but if they do, they should be educated to take responsibility the next time they encounter the situation. Abortion is a serious topic, and unfortunately, not enough take it seriously."
"I have always suported abortion,For the sole purpose That a woman Has the right to choose what happens in her life and body. Thier are sercomstances to all decitions .Weather it be rape, incest, finances or danger of her life. I think everyone should mind thier own business,and try to focus on thier own tuff decitions in thier lives.Do not judge and turn thier other cheek in the other direction."
"Sometimes in life we are presented with challenges. These challenges can come in the form of very difficult decisions. One of those decisions maybe whether or not to have an abortion. This decision should not be taken lightly but there are many good reasons why you should have the choice to do so. One of those is the horrible instance of rape. The other is an inconvenient pregnancy."
"While abortion is a relatively simple medical procedure, there are complicated ethical issues surrounding it, and it is wrong to approach the topic with absolutism. In general, it should be avoided since it is irreversible, except when the life of the mother is in danger. On the other hand, it is wrong to force a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term - this is clearly involuntary servitude. Until there are more medical alternatives available, even elective abortion should be permitted, though alternatives should be provided and encouraged."
"I think abortion is a good thing. I think that it is better to abort a child that your not ready for than raise it unprepared. I also think it is a good thing for teens that have been raped and are not ready for a child. Or just so that there is less babies in trash cans and buried in back yards."
"I believe that abortion is nothing short of murder. There is only one possible reason for a person to get an abortion and this if the pregnancy is due to rape. There are many couples striving to get pregnant and give a child a good home and if you have an unwanted pregnancy adoption is the best choice. Every child deserves a chance at life."
"I believe that in certain circumstances abortion should be legal. Imagine a young girl of thirteen getting raped, or even making the mistake of getting pregnant. Her body is not properly formed to be able to carry a child. Not only would the pregnancy be difficult, in most cases, the delivery would be traumatic. This would put both mother and baby at a high risk. In the case of a pregnancy of such a young person being raped, it could halt the healing of the victim if she were forced to carry the baby to full term. She would also always carry the scars in the form of stretch marks to remind her of the rape."
"Life begins at conception. From the moment the DNA of two parents combines, a new entity, unique from all others, has come into existence. It does not gain an irreparable right to exist until it implants - thus beginning a chance to be born. Thus women who use the pill or contraception aren't committing a crime or sin - only those who end a naturally occurring pregnancy have ended a potential human life. And with so many families eager to adopt a child, healthy or not, all children are wanted, whether or not the birth mother does."
"If you have ever felt a baby kick in your tummy or the breath of a new born in your ear you will understand why abortion is wrong. Within that little body is a heart, just like yours, a brain with the ability to learn, just as you do, babies are simply little people. Are you allowed to kill a person who you don't really want in your life? Nope. Can you simply get rid of a person because they beside you when you would rather be along? Nope. Why is abortion any different."
"Abortion, although horrible, is sometimes necessary. Being a man, I will never have to be in the position of having an abortion myself so my opinion is somewhat biased in that respect. Since I lack the personal insight about abortion that is so integrally tied to being a woman, I cannot rightfully say that abortion is wrong. Even ignoring this fact, I know that there are extenuating circumstances that can make having an abortion a better choice than not having an abortion. Sometimes one has to choose between the lesser of two evils and sometimes abortion is less wrong."
"While I don't believe that abortion should ever be taken lightly, I do think that abortion should be legal. It should be available to all adults and those minors who have been victims of a rape or incest. There are too many situations where women get pregnant due to force. The government should have no right to force those women to carry a baby full-term and experience the horrible event that caused that pregnancy every day for nine months! I also think that while there are many wonderful people out there who are willing to adopt unwanted babies and give them happy homes, the government regulations make it difficult and often too expensive for many of these families to pursue adoption. So, without abortion, many of the babies in unplanned pregnancies would be left to die in the back alleyways or grow up being past around in the foster care system. What kind of life is that to give a child?"
"Abortion should be a personal decision. Women should have the right to their own body. Someone that was raped should have the right to abortion if she wants to. Someone with genetic defects that will be passed on to their children or even HIV+ patients should also be able to abort their child if conceived by accident. A 13 year old girl that got pregnant ignorantly should be able to abort so it does not ruin the rest of her live. Yes, people should take responsibility of their own actions but this should not be done such that you are dragging down another soul with you. The baby is innocent, you do not want another abandoned child that lives in the orphanage or have serious illness to suffer the rest of their lives just because mothers could not end their lives before it is too late, before they have to suffer. The world is over-populated/infested with people, we should be limiting our growth rate. If you want to have unhealthy children, unwanted children or children that weren't brought up correctly, then choose to prevent abortion. So that there will be more people with genetic defects, illness or mental instability in our future generations. We should not be against abortion, because we should believe everyone have a choice. In place of preventing abortion completely, we should have counselors that can help the women make better decisions regarding this action. Better informed women will make better choices for themselves and their babies."
"Abortion is considered as a sin, but there can be circumstances where one is forced to take such a decision as there may be no other options available. I do not consider abortion as a sin. Logically speaking, human beings have a reproductive cycle in which if you concieve, you need not go ahead and have a child always. Its just the matter of sperm meeting the egg, that's all. Now, if you want the child you keep it, else there's always a way out - called Abortion. You are commiting no sin by aborting the feotus. Its always better not to have a child, rather than give birth to it and then make the baby feel unwanted."
"I believe a woman should have a right to get an abortion. She should even not pay for it as well for contraceptive and condoms.. Then she should get a day or two off from work (paid) in order to rest. A woman has a right to decide when is a proper time to give birth to a child."
"I am supportive of abortion in certain scenerios. If you are informed that you will have a baby with severe deformities or medical issues and are not prepared to deal or except them, I belive it okay to abort. I believe in the scientific point that supports the stage in which the fetus becomes a human being. I do not believe that abortion is murder. I believe it is a choice when adoption is far more painful to bare for some mothers."
"I believe that abortion should remain legal. If abortion was to be outlawed many women and girls would lose their lives. There would be cases of self-induced abortions. There is a history of that happening. I believe that there are times when abortions are the only answer. For instance, cases of incest, rape, and severe handicaps in the child."
"Abortion is a necessary evil. In a world where there is rape by family members and other sexual violent acts abortion beomes necessary. In cases where continuing with a pregnancy will kill both mother and baby, abortions are necessary. In order to keep personal freedom for all and imposing our religious views on others abortion should be allowed."
"From the moment you concieve a child it is a life. To abort a child is murder, pure and simple. It is my opinion that without seeing the baby, or feeling the baby move and kick it makes it easier to go through with an abortion. Out of all the woman who have had abortions, I wonder what percentage could kill a baby after it had been born. There are always other options. I wish the aborted fetus could say that."
"Abortion should be regulated by the law. Those that use it as a way to correct what they believe to be a mistake should not beable to just end a life because it isn't convenient for them. Some say that no woman should be forced to have a baby, but I believe that they were not forced to have sex.some will say that if a rape caused the pregancy then an abortion should be an option also. How can we say it is okay to punish the inocent child for what a rapist does? Who is reallAboty paying for the crime? Instead lets get all the help we can for the pregant mother during those nine months and afterwards weather she chooses to keep the baby or not. Of course I do feel that there are times that abortion is the only option when it is done to save the mother's life."
"It is my belief that abortion should be no ones business other than that of the mother whom is carrying the child. It is a personal matter that should be treated as such, and thus, no one should be able to tell a mother what she can and cannot do with her body. Legislation on abortion is completely absurd, as it undermines the very principles of our nation, which are Personal Liberty, and a government that doesn't intrude in to our lives on matters such as abortion."
"When I formed my opinion on abortion, I thought of three things. First, I do not believe that life begins at conception. I don't think we yet know enough about the formation process of a fetus to be able to pinpoint exactly when they are able to feel, but I know enough biology to know it's not early on in the pregnancy. Second, I believe that a woman should have the final say in what happens to her body. Pregnancy takes a huge toll on a woman, and she should be prepared for that, not forced into it. Thirdly, I think about what kind of life this unborn child would have, coming in the world to parents who are not financially or emotionally ready to be parents. For all these reasons, I completely support a woman's right to choose."
"Abortion should be the legal choice of the mother at all times before the fetus can survive without mechanical assistance. I recognize a complex set of legal and ethical issues are involved, but the legal standards would be more inconsistent without this choice. Although in some instances, the murder of a pregnant mother counts as two murders, but in all other legal situations a pregnant mother can not make use of facilities such as carpool lanes reserved for two or more passengers. The unborn child has no legal identity, no documentation in government records. The unborn child dramatically affects the health and welfare of the mother, in many cases the mother of an unwanted child has many healthcare parallels with a cancer patient. Just as a mother has a choice to seek appropriate medical treatment for other conditions affecting her health, she should have control of her own body when the fetus is having undesired affect on her health."
"I believe that the choice to have an abortion is a highly personal one. Abortions are an unfortunate fact of life. They have been taking place in one form or another for centuries. It's a known fact that abortions done under unsanitary conditions will create a risk to the life of the mother. Therefore, I believe that abortions should be legal for reasons of public health."
"I do not believe that a supreme being exists, there is no such thing as a sole. As such a woman is under no obligation to carry a bunch of cells to term. pregnancy is a major health risk and if a woman does not wish to take that risk it is her decision. Further I find the idea that the government has some right to intrude in anyone's personal medical decisions repugnant. We have separation of church and state for a reason and do not need to codify religion in our laws."
"Regardless of specific religious beliefs, the vast majority of humanity knows or feels instinctively that it's wrong to kill another person. I'm 100% positive that no one among us knows exactly when human life actually begins. Since it can be from the only starting point we know of, conception, how can you say whether you're killing a human being or not if you perform or have an abortion? The answer is of course that you don't know. Therefore, no one has the right to decide arbitrarily that a fetus at any given stage is not human, and can be killed without the risk of snuffing out the life of an actual person."
"I am a man, so abortion does not directly affect my body. However, I support womens' right to choose whether or not they carry the babies growing inside their bodies to term. I believe that every citizen has the right to the private control of his body, whether through drugs, sport, meditation, medicine, etc. This right would extend to birth control and abortion issues. If I were to get a woman pregnant, I would hope we could both make an informed decision about the options science has made available to us."
"I would be pro abotion.Think about all the women who have been raped,molested, or date raped.It would already be tragmatic for a women who was in a bad situation like that and it would be even worse for her to carry to term knowing that her child is from a man she not only was not in love with, but also forced himself upon her. Also with techinogly you can find out if your child has even life threating genetic defects.You baby could be born with something such as cycstic frobrois and would have to go through painfully sugeries and testing.Also the rate of cycstic frobrois and death is VERY HIGH and it would be devesating for a mother to care for and raise her child only to lose him/her only a short period of time later."
"A hungry child, drug addicted parent, not wanted, welfare, abused, abandoned. Without the choice this is the life of a child born and NOT cared for. Abortion is NOT wrong it is a choice of the woman."
"I believe in a woman's right to chose, the goverment has no right to control our reproductive abilities. Victims of violence or those with dangerous health conditions should have the ability to decide for themselves whether to follow through with a pregnancy. The ability to terminate a pregancy is not modern invention, thousands of years ago plants and herbs were used for a variety of reasons if a women did not want or was not able to care for the child. And once we open the door to letting somebody else control our reproductive abilities where do you draw the line? Is outlawing birthcontrol and condoms next?"
"Abortion is the killing of an innocent life. Life begins at conception. When a woman has an abortion she is having her unborn baby killed. Abortion should be outlawed. Prevention and adoption should be promoted. When you see a beating heart of a baby on an ultrasound there is no dening that the baby is alive."
"Abortion is wrong and should never be resorted to, unless in very extreme cases where the life of the mother and/or the fetus is in danger. Even then it should be used sparingly. Abortion is not birth control. Birth control is something you do BEFORE a baby is conceived. Abortion is killing a baby that you have already conceived. And life begins at conception - a baby just a few weeks old has a beating heart. Some people would argue that abortion is a woman's choice, but what about the child's choice? The baby is being killed for her convenience. It is totally wrong. When an unwanted pregnancy occurs, the only humane option is adoption. Abortion is deliberately taking steps to end a life, to stop a beating heart. That is murder."
"I think abortion should be legal. Those who want to abort their kids should have the option to do that. Those who do not want to do that have the freedom to do that also. The choice should be that of the mother and father of the kid."
"I don't believe in abortion. The adult has the say if she is to have sex without protection and the unborn embryo has no say. The only time an abortion should be allowed is in the instance of rape. The person doesn't have the say there and sometimes the child will be the reminder of the rape and be punished for that crime."
""I believe there are times when abortions should be performed. In the case of rape, incest (and the male family member should be prosectued) or when the mother is not in any position to raise the child, this includes teenagers. I would not expect someone to carry a child to term and give it up for adoption, women are not incubators and this could be emotionally damaging to the woman. My beliefs do not fit the ""Pro Choice Agenda"" since I do not agree with abortion on demand and I shun females who do not practice birth control, figuring they can just get an abortion instead.""
"Abortion is a sign of inhumanity. I'm only think it's alright if the girl is really young, like 13-14 young. It's a crime. And like any crimes, it should be punished severly."
""I believe abortion is a matter of free choice for women. If a woman finds herself in an unwanted pregnancy she should have the right to terminate that pregnancy in safe medical environment. We should not force women back into dirty clinics and the days of coat hanger hacks performing rotor rooter procedures on women. A woman should have the right to choose whether or not she is in a station in life to give birth to a child and then either raise that child herself or give it up for adoption. Adoption is admirable and certainly does allow loving parents to have babies that they may not be otherwise able to have; and provides able and willing women the opportunity to give birth to their baby and see it placed in a loving environment. The nine months of pregnancy and act of child birth is not insignificant and a woman in an unwanted pregnancy should not be forced to follow through it. ""
""Abortion is flatly wrong. I understand that it's a difficult thing for a woman to carry a baby for 9 months, but we all have to make difficult sacrifices sometimes. And simply put, an unborn baby is a human life, and human life needs to be protected. It's not ok for a woman to kill her baby just because it inconveniences her; would we stay it's ok for a woman to kill a two year old just because it inconveniences her?""
"I feel that women should be able to have the choice of whether or not they want to have the baby. If they don't want to, then they should be able to stop it because they are the person who has to have the baby and to take care of it. If they want to have it and feel they are ready then they should. Choice is what makes this country so great and women should have it regarding abortion."
"I believe abortion should be an individual decision and we should respect and tolerate our differences. It should not be placed on a level of religion, which creates some of the the most common and insane reasons to start wars. Not in God's name, but man's name. How can it be fair to dictate to a woman, who is the victim of rape or incest, to carry to term, that which will cause mental anguish for the rest of her life? The child thus becomes a victim as well. Let alone, when is it ever our right, to force someone to live in only our viewpoint? If that is the destiny of mankind, then why not invite the reincarnation of Hitler!"
"I have absolutely no problem with abortion. I believe that the world will become a better place if all unwanted children are not born. I am not a religious person, so that in no way clouds my judgment on the subject. Whether or not a woman decides that she is ready and prepared to have a child is her business."
""The decision of whether or not to have an abortion is something that should lie solely with the woman who is pregnant. The fact that the government wants to impede her right to make that decision is preposterous. I believe that the main reason people in the government are against it is that they are men. The second reason people think it's wrong is because the church tells them so, even though people should form their own opinions, not just listen to what their church tells them is wrong or right. That people are allowed to carry guns makes them capable of ending another's life at any time; that's legal--why shouldn't abortion be? For the record, it should be noted that many of these ""pro-life"" individuals also own guns.""
"I am completely against abortion. In my opinion, murder is murder. When a person aborts a baby, that person is taking a life. I do not agree with a baby never getting to experience life due to irresponsible parents. I believe that abortion should be illegal in every state."
"Women should have the choice to decide whether or not they can perform abortion. God gave us the free will to make our own decisions. I personally was a child of choice and when given the all the information, an appropriate decision was made. Women should not feel restricted as to the options they have, but they should not be underinformed either. Those that have been raped or medically need abortions should be given the choice especially. Those raped were forced to do something that they did not want to do and by forcing them to choose life is another atrocity in itself. They are forced to relive for 9 to 10 months the crime that was committed. For those that medically need the procedure, by having no choice but to choose life, they are condemned to death. Who decides which life is more important? Should this decision be made by other people whose life is not on the line?"
"My opinion in all honestly on abortion is that it is wrong. Abortion is such a terrible way to go out. Even though the young child does not have a name, attributes it is still so wrong to take that life away. People go to jail for years for murder, shouldn't the parents, doctor go to jail they are causing the same exact crime. Abortion should be banned and not allowed in any country on this planet. People who mess up and dont want kids but have them have to deal with the fact that they did this to themselves."
"I believe abortion should only be limited to rape and insest victims. There is no need for it to be avalible to the general public. It is murder. If you are careless enough to get pregnant, you should take responsibility and have the baby. People should have the child and only then can they give it up for adoption if they choose. It is not the child's fault and they should have the right to life."
""Although from a Christian perspective the sanctity of unborn life is a given, that fact alone is not enough to convince the general population of the evil of abortion. But let it be known it is an evil! How many millions of lives are thrown away every year, usually for the ""convenience"" of the mother/family. Even in more legitimate cases, how sad that society will not step in to care for the new life-to-be. It is this aspect that should be made known to America: The choice of life and its preservation is more important than any consideration, especially ones that often boil down to personal selfishness.""
"I feel that abortion is wrong. If killing a pregnant mother is double homicide, than it is a double standard that aborting a baby is not murder. Life starts at conception, not after 3 months. At any time in the pregnancy, whether it's partial-birth abortion or not, it is murder to abort the baby. If it is a choice, then the girl should have made the choice not to have sex in the first place. Actions have consequences."
"I think abortion is such a difficult topic because it is something far too personal to be decided by a group or government. I used to believe it was simply wrong, and I still don't think I could have one except in very dire circumstances, but I don't want to be made to have a baby that I cannot face carrying due to some difficult personal life circumstances either."
"Abortion is an ugly topic, but it's not something that can be ignored. A child coming from an unwanted pregnancy will be much more likely to turn to crime, since their mother will not be prepared or willing to take proper care of them. If someone is already in financial difficulty, having a child will only worsen this state, and the child might even be abandoned. I think in some cases abortions are probably the best option, for both the sake of the mother, and the child itself, since the child's quality of life may have been terrible if it were to live. Other points to consider are whether the child was concieved by rape, whether or not the mother has substance abuse problems, and whether or not the child was the product of incest. Late stage abortions on the other hand, are almost too sickening to think about."
"Abortion should be legal. The unborn fetus should only be allowed to be born if that is the choice of the mother. There should not be any religious interpretation about this at all. This should solely be the choice between a women and her doctor."
"Every woman should have the right to choose. Abortion should be a personal choice made by a woman with her doctor's input. The government should not have control over a woman's reproductive organs. A fetus is not a distinct person with human rights until it is able to survive outside the mother's womb. Until the fetus becomes mature enough that it could survive outside the womb (even in a neonatal unit)the woman's health and well-being should always be put first. This tiny, dependent creature, less complex than a grasshopper is a potential human but not yet a person."
"I believe that women have the right to choose where abortion is concerned. It is the woman's own body and she has the right to decide whether or not she wants to terminate the pregnancy. Any other opinion grossly infringes upon a woman's social, moral and legal rights and is not just in every sense of the word."
"Abortion is never an easy choice for a woman, but the government has no right to make that choice for her. I believe that the outlines laid down in Roe V Wade were sensible. They demonstrated applicable concern for the right to privacy. A woman's body is ultimately hers and hers alone, and the government should not impose restrictions upon it. While I understand the religious and moral objections to the action, I believe that these should not be used as a basis to impede on the freedom of another."
"Every woman has her right to choose what to do with her body. Someone should not be forced to have a baby if they are not ready or financially able to provide for that child. No one should be able to choose for someone else, especially on such a big decision as this. If abortion is illegal, people will find more harmful ways to get to the same conculsion."
"I think that abortion is not really a good way to go when you have a child. I understand that in some cases it is not a good idea to have the child but that is why they have adoption services to find them a good home. Of course they are those times when a woman was violated and I understand the pain she feels and that they would not want to have that child but the child didn't ask to be made. I feel they should still have the child and just give it up for adoption so that it has a chance to have a good life."
"I believe that abortion is a very personal matter only to be determined by the person(s) involved. I personally would probably never have an abortion, but I do believe there are circumstances to which it would be an option. I believe that if the child has such horrible birth defects that they can never live a good life that abortion could be an option. Also in the event of rape or incest I believe it could be a possibility. All in all my belief is that abortion is a very personal matter."
""Abortion is wrong because a person is given a soul at the moment of conception. God said that He knew you before you were formed. A baby has a heartbeat and brain wave activity weeks before the woman even realizes she may be pregnant. If it weren't for Planned Parenthood's concerted effort to force abortion as a right and even change the way we think, we would all still realize that abortion is murder. Calling the baby a zygote or a fetus dehumanizes the baby. ""I think, therefore I am.""
"My position on abortion is pro-choice. I think the Supreme Court got it right on the Roe vs. Wade case when they said the decision to have an abortion is a personal, private decision that should not be infringed on by the government. This is especially acute in situations of rape and incest where the woman or child's rights have already been violated. No one should be forced to go through a pregnancy and every child who comes into the world should be welcomed and loved freely."
""I believe abortion is morally wrong. It is a sin for a mother to kill her unborn child. Human life begins at conception, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. I believe what the Bible infers in Psalms chapter 139 verses 13-16: ""For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully \u0026 wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be."" Abortion is murder. I believe the unborn child is created by God and He has a purpose for him/her. God is not necessarily pleased by certain unfortunate circumstances of pregnancy, but when conception occurs, He knows about it and loves the child and has a particular plan for that child's life in this world.""
"I believe the choice of abortion should remain with the parents of the unborn child. Mother should have more rights to decide what to do. If abortion is needed because the foetus has some deformity, then there is nothing wrong with it. Apart from that I feel it is the choice of a person whether to go for abortion or not. Our culture and society terms abortion as cruel, so I personally would prefer to keep away from it, except for life threatening situation. I would definitely be guilt ridden."
""I believe abortion is equivalent to murder. However, I think it should be an available option to only a few certain cases. Abortion should be limited to women with health issues, or women who are victims of rape. It should not be available to those who are careless and can ""erase"" their own mistake. Making abortion available to everyone allows reckless women to have unprotected sex without the worry of getting pregnant, because they can just ""fix"" it afterwards.""
""I am a pro-choice person; however, I am pro-life for myself. I do not believe that the government should be able to tell any woman what to do with her body or pregnancy. I do believe that life begins at conception. I would only have an abortion if I were raped or the baby or myself was in danger. I do not believe that abortion should be used instead of birth control. I feel that sex education is key in limiting the number of abortions needed/wanted in our country.""
"I think that abortion is morally wrong. However, I also think that it isn't the governments place to dictate what people do with their bodies. Even if abortion were to be outlawed, they would still occur. Probably with more risks attached, too. Think about the war on drugs. If drugs were legal, gang revenues would be cut, violence would go down, drug purity (and therefor safety) would go up. But since they are illegal, gangs sell them on the street to make money which they use to kill people, and the drugs are cut with god knows what. Abortion would be no different. We would have women pulling fetuses out of their uterus with coat hangers and all other kinds of nasty things. Doesn't make sense to have a law that can't be enforced."
"When does life begin? Proponents of abortion would say that science can't determine that answer. If it can't be determined, then it must begin at conception. It is illogical to say that at 2 months, 30 days there isn't a life growing inside a woman (when a woman can get an abortion), but at 3 months there is a life (when a woman can't get an abortion). Just because a pregnancy might not be convenient for a woman doesn't mean there isn't a life growing within her."
"I believe that abortion is wrong, but only because I believe life begins at conception. This debate comes down to that point, no matter the range of arguments for or against abortion. Where does life begin? This is the question that must be answered. The baby that will emerge has its own DNA, its own blood type, and many more features that distinguish him or her from simply being a part of the mother's body. Because I believe abortion is wrong, that does not mean I am unwilling to sacrifice that baby's life to save the mother. Therefore, I do not believe it should be illegal to kill the baby in that case."
"I believe that abortion is a tragic choice, but it is just that: a choice. I have reached a philosophical viewpoint in which I do not think I could choose to have an abortion, but I still believe that it should be the woman's decision as to whether she brings an unplanned pregnancy to term. We should focus on reducing abortion by making birth control more accessible and affordable, and providing thorough education. We should also make sure that women know all their options so they can make a truly informed decision. I fully believe that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare."
"It's not for the government to decide what a woman chooses for herself. Just as it's not for government to decide what any citizen chooses for him or herself. Abortion is no different as a choice than any other topic, it's simply more inflammatory. There is nothing here to legislate. It is one person being given the opportunity to decide what is right for themselves."
"I believe in pro- choice. There are certain times when an abortion is necessary. Not only in the cases of rape or incest, but when the future of a young girl is on the line. No sixteen year old should see her and her child's life trashed because of poverty and lack of options in the world."
"I believe that everyone should have the right to choose. While I can not think of any circumstances under which I would personally opt to have an abortion, I do not think that it is my right to make that decision for another person. Just because I believe that aborting a baby is not something I could ever live with spiritually or emotionally, does not mean I think that I can deign to judge someone elses decision to have one. I do not believe that abortion should be used as a form of birth control and I feel that people who do have frequent abortions should have to talk with a counselor of some sort before any subsequent abortions."
"Abortion should be legal. In horrific cases such as rape, incest, an inherited disease or genetic condition, or when a woman's life is in danger due to the pregnancy, the option to abort should be given. As long as women get pregnant, there will be women having abortions. The only difference is a that a woman can go to a real doctor who can perform the operation safely and humanely or go to a quack. If social programs such as welfare, medicaid, social service agencies, headstart and other programs are not adequately funded (as in many states they are not) it is almost as bad allowing a child grow up without a safety net, without a family, without ever knowing what it is like to be loved and cared for than it is to have an abortion."
"Abortion should be a choice given to any woman who is pregnant. The burden is hers to keep or disown. When a fetus is still small, it won't miss out on anything good in life, so it is not murder. When an unwanted child is put into the world, their life is bad, and it could have been prevented by having abortion. Besides, preventing abortion may risk dangerous abortions that are done outside of hospitals."
"I am against abortion. I think it's demoralizing, and I also think girls use it as an easy out of pregnancy. They dont realize theyre taking a human life, and dont want to face the consequences. I think abortion should only be legalized in the event that the mother is in grave danger or the baby is."
"I am pro-abortion because I support the fact that a woman, and only a woman, has the right to decide what she does with her body. A woman's reproductive system should not be controlled over by the government. It is an individual woman's choice whether or not she wants to have a child. There are so many factors that can make a woman not want to have a child that I believe the government has no right to take control over."
"In life, there are things that eat out our life like cancer hollows our body: abortion on demand is one of these cancers. It allows us to devalue another human life and turns a human being's Constitutional rights a matter of another's opinion. It weakens our moral fiber, as it weakens our willingness to stand for what it right not what is easy, what benefits others instead of what benefits us, what is is best for another instead of just for us, what is good for the long term rather than easier at the present. It weakens our country as 50 million people who would be voting, paying Social Security, creating and buying products are all gone -- the toll of abortion since Roe vs. Wade. Worst of all, it weakens me, since I an willing to surrender another's life for my comfort. If you believe that I am willing to force my will on another without having experienced their pain, you're wrong. I and my wife made made this choice once, and I can tell you that it was the wrong choice. It was the convenient choice, even an economically and socially acceptable choice at the time. It was still the wrong one."
"I believe that abortion is murder. Discarding a human life in this manner is wrong socially and spiritually. Personally, I could not live with myself if I destroyed a life out of selfishness. I think there are rare cases when the mothers life is in jeopardy and it could be considered. I am not saying that I agree with it in this situation but this is the only reason that I can justify abortion."
"To me, abortion is a solution to a problem. The fact that the problem seems to mostly arise from not being careful in our behaviors troubles me. If we were more careful in preventing pregnancy in the first place, abortion procedures could be limited to medical necessity or in rape cases. And then ultimately, the solution of abortion becomes a problem from the possible physical and emotional trauma that occurs after the procedure. So I believe in pro-choice but believe that it is an imperfect solution that has risks and consequences."
"I believe that abortion is not an option. I believe that from conception, a life was created. Why or how could anyone have an abortion and take matters in their own hands. How could they decide that the 'life' they conceived doesn't deserve to 'live'. That is the choice of a much higher power. It should not be ours. If you don't want to keep the baby, there are always alternative means..adoption for a childless couple for one."
"Abortion rights are natural law, and have no place being decided on a political level. A woman's body is hers to govern, not yours. If a woman has decided that at this time in her life she is not prepared to be the best mother she can be to a child, then far be it from me to judge her decision. If a woman is beaten, raped, and left for dead in a field, why should she be forced to keep a baby that is not a creation of a loving union between two partners? Being pregnant should not be the be all end all of sex. If I choose to engage in sex with a man, that is my choice. If that sex results in a pregnancy, it is my body and my mind that should be making the decision, not someone elses religion, not someone elses opinion. Should someone else be allowed to decide if I can eat, breathe, speak, or even have sex? That would be preposterous. So, then, why do some people think they can tell me what I can and can't do with my own body in regards to abortion? It is completely absurd."
"Abortion in the United States is not clinical and safe. It is presumed that since abortions are performed as a medical procedure that all doctors are licensed, and the doctors that are ethical and competent. It is taken for granted that any medical procedures that take place in the United States are guaranteed safe from malpractice and ill-educated people. Abortion is a hot topic that brings out the religious fanatics that have bomb clinics in attempts to intimidate and close abortion clinics. Most doctors shy away from such controversy and threats and therefore, shrinks the number of doctors that are competent and increasing the risk of incompetent doctors."
"In my opinion, abortion is wrong. I've been presented with a situation in my own life where not having an abortion put myself at personal risk. But when looking at my other children, I could not bear to think that I had terminated the life of one of my children to save myself. I believe that life begins at conception and that all persons have the right no life. As human beings, this is our most precious gift. To terminate a life is to throw away a gift from God and the future of man."
"I am against abortion. I feel that to get an abortion done is a crime equivalent to murder. You are killing an unborn child and taking away his chance of coming into this world. The innocent soul to whom God has given the chance to come in human form is being deprived of this golden opportunity. Spirituality says that it is only in human form that one can realize oneself to be a soul and know God. By aborting a child one is also doing a sin for which one has to pay in future according to the law of karma."
"Every woman should have a choice, especially over her own body. I agree that voluntary abortion should be made legal everywhere. It should also be affordable and accessible to all women. Women should be able to go to place where she is comfortable and can have an abortion safely and without any judgment or fear. To tell a woman what she can do with her own body is a crime. While I respect all life, I also respect a woman's choice."
""I believe abortion is pro-choice. My reasons for this belief are simple. There are situations where a woman is either raped or has a loveless marriage in which she cannot afford to bring a child into this world and the father will not support her and has left her or has chose to help her ""fix"" the situation. It takes two to tango, so if the father walks why not the mother. Why should the mother be left ""holding the baby""? Nine times out of ten the child will have a hard life and because his/her mother is single, the child will become a detriment to society. Not to mention the social issues this child will have because he/she are growing up with one parent. No, pro-choice is the way to go and is best for the parents and society."
"Regardless of your opinion on abortion, you must realize that the choice is not yours. This country is known for freedom, including freedom of choice. Forcing someone else to conform to your morality when it does not affect you in any way is wrong. If you don't support abortion, then don't have one."
""I believe that abortion is a personal choice. As it is such a personal choice, the government does not have the right to mandate abortion. No woman deserves to have her choice denigrated, nor do they deserve to be shouted at and called ""baby killers"" while entering the clinic. I freely admit that abortion is not an ideal solution, but the fact remains that it is a legal and personal solution to a difficult situation. Lest we go back to the days of coat hangers and back-alley procedures, abortion needs to remain safe and legal."
"I don't know what to think about abortion. What does it mean to have a soul, if indeed people have souls, when you're just a fetus? Does the soul care at that point whether it lives or dies, and does the abortion have any adverse effect upon the soul? There are too many unanswered questions about who we are as human beings for me to form a reasonable opinion on the matter. I don't think I could personally abort anything. It seems a little heartless to me."
"The option of abortion is and always should be legal and at the sole discretion of the female in which the embryo/fetus resides, regardless of her age... geographical location... the situation leading to the unwanted pregnancy or her prior history of/with abortion. At no time during pregnancy does an embryo/fetus possess the same faculties or level of coherent consciousness of a newborn baby. There is no baby in pregnancy, only in birth and thus a fetus is never a sentient being with rights. Males need to accept the fact that their rights to any say as to what happens to their genetic material starts when they decide to have intercourse, stops when they ejaculate and could possibly resume after the female decides to make her body available to the fetus for the entirety of the gestational period. Said rights are not equal but neither are the part each sex has to play in the formation of what may become a baby."
"The abortion it's the best solution for the women. It's very clear that the sexual and reproductive rights of the women must be protected. The history and the laws recognize the right to choose freely if she wants to become a mother. Because that, the right of a woman that wants to interrupt her pregnancy must be defended at any costs. Believe me, it's better an abortion that a homeless or abused child."
"Abortion is a really tricky subject. I deeply believe that women have the right to make their own choices about their bodies. No one should make that choice for them, not their parents, spouses or government. A woman's right to abortion should be protected. However, there is just something horribly sad about that loss of potential life. I wish women never had to put in that position in the first place. Perhaps better sex education would change our conversation about the need for abortion."
""Let's face it. There is no God, at least not a fatherly lovely one. Which father will let his sons suffer horribly as we do everyday ? So let's forget about religion or absolute values in our discussion. The only thing that I rate is pain. I do not like pain (either physical or mental) and I believe everybody should at least try to reduce the pain he inflict on other human beings, try to not augment the amount of sorrow on the earth. Since I do not attribute an ""absolute"" value to life, I believe that a life of pain has no reason and I believe that there are already too many useless human beings and too many unloved human beings. So it is a crime to bring to life a human being with with high probability will be unloved, crippled or homeless. It is better to kill it before he is conscious. And yes, I know it is sort of a murder, but I prefer it done early than later."
